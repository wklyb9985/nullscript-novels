# Chapter 2 — Recommended Action: Improbable

The seam opens like a mouth remembering how to scream.

Not fast—nothing about deep infrastructure moves fast, I'm learning—but with a grinding inevitability that makes the floor vibrate through my boots and into my teeth. Blue light hemorrhages from the wound in the lattice wall, brighter than the tunnel rods, brighter than the Arbiter's mask-seam, bright enough to write shadows on the backs of my eyelids when I blink.

The Arbiter pivots away from me.

That's new. That's interesting. That's the first time since this nightmare started that something official has looked at something other than me like it might be a bigger problem.

I file this information under *useful* and *terrifying*.

"Kael," Nia hisses. "What did you do?"

"Nothing yet. That's the scary part."

The root fault pulses. Each pulse sends a ripple through the tunnel that I feel in my Fault-Sight before my body—a shudder in the math of things, probability values flickering like candle flames in wind. The support lattice around us groans. Rivets pop. A section of pipe overhead sags three inches and vents superheated steam in a shrieking whistle.

The Arbiter raises its impossible spear and drives the tip into the floor.

Light erupts in concentric rings—white, surgical, perfect. Where the rings touch the root fault's bleed, the blue dims. Containment. It's trying to seal the wound while also, presumably, planning to delete me at its leisure.

Multitasking. I respect that. I also resent it.

**FAULT EXPANSION: 14% AND RISING**
**CONTAINMENT AUTHORITY: ARBITER-7 HALCYON**
**SECONDARY TARGET: HOLD**

Secondary target. That's me. On hold, like a complaint at a guild office.

"We need to move while it's distracted," Nia says, already calculating angles. Her knives are still out but she's smart enough to know they'd bounce off that armor like insults off a tax collector.

"Move where? Door's sealed behind us, death machine ahead."

"Past it. The fault's pulling its attention. We go wide, stay against the left wall, hit the service branch twenty yards behind it."

I look at the gap between the Arbiter and the tunnel wall. Maybe four feet. Maybe less when it shifts.

"That's not a plan. That's a prayer with running shoes."

"Best I've got."

Fair enough.

We run.

Nia moves like water finding a crack—low, fast, silent, hugging the curved wall where shadows pool thickest. I move like a sack of potatoes someone kicked down a hill, but I move *quickly*, which counts for something.

The Arbiter doesn't turn. Its full focus is on the fault, spear pulsing white fire into the wound, rings of containment light stacking like coins. But as I pass within arm's reach—

My Fault-Sight flares hot.

Not at the root fault. At the Arbiter itself.

I see it. Hairline mismatches running along the plates of its armor, tiny value conflicts where containment protocol and pursuit protocol fight for processing priority. It's trying to do two things at once, and the overlap creates friction.

Friction I can read.

Friction I can *use*.

The thought arrives fully formed, like a key sliding into a lock I didn't know I'd been carrying. My new trait—Improvised Exploit—wakes up and starts talking in a language I barely understand.

*Chain them*, it says. Not in words. In intuition. In the same gut-logic that tells you a staircase is about to give way.

The Arbiter's containment pulses sync every 1.3 seconds. Each pulse momentarily suppresses the fault. Between pulses, the fault pushes back. That push-pull creates micro-gaps in the lattice support structure—moments where the tunnel's physical integrity runs on faith and habit rather than actual reinforcement.

If I hit one of those gaps with enough force at exactly the wrong time—

I stop running.

"Kael!" Nia is ten yards ahead, at the service branch. "What are you doing?"

"Something stupid."

"Be specific!"

"Structurally stupid!"

I drop to one knee and press my palm flat against the tunnel floor. Fault-Sight floods my vision. Red stress lines everywhere, a web of tiny wrongnesses, each one insignificant alone.

But together—

**Improvised Exploit (Rank 1) activated**
**Chaining local mismatches: 7 identified**
**Cascade probability: 31%**
**Warning: Collateral structural failure likely**

Thirty-one percent. That's not good odds. That's the kind of odds you take when the alternative is *submit for erasure*.

I push.

Not physically. Not magically, in the way scholars would recognize. I push my awareness into the mismatches—a corroded support bolt here, a pressure differential there, a timing gap in the containment pulse cycle, a thermal expansion mismatch in the pipe overhead, three separate micro-faults in the floor grating where stress has never been properly resolved.

Seven tiny wrongnesses.

I tell them to be wrong *together*.

The bolt fails. The pipe drops. The pressure differential becomes a pressure *event*. The floor grating buckles, which shifts the wall load, which catches the pipe drop, which redirects steam into the containment ring at the exact moment between pulses—

The Arbiter staggers.

One step. Just one step to the side, spear wavering, mask-seam flickering.

But that one step carries its containment anchor off-center by eighteen inches, and the root fault—patient, hungry, already pushing—surges through the gap.

Blue light detonates.

The tunnel ceiling cracks in a line that races ahead of me like a living thing. Lattice supports buckle. The floor tilts. Behind the Arbiter, a section of tunnel simply *ceases to exist as a tunnel* and becomes a wall of collapsed stone and twisted metal, dust billowing outward in a hot, choking wave.

I'm already running. Nia grabs my collar as I reach the service branch and hauls me sideways into a narrow passage as the collapse roars past like a train made of geology.

We scramble. We cough. We run some more. Behind us, the sound goes on and on—stone grinding, metal shrieking, the deep tectonic groan of infrastructure rearranging its relationship with gravity.

Then silence.

Not peaceful silence. The loaded, ringing silence of aftermath, where the world is catching its breath before deciding if it's done being angry.

Nia and I are wedged in a pipe junction barely wide enough for two people, our backs against opposing walls, breathing hard. Dust makes ghosts of the air between us.

"You collapsed the tunnel," she says.

"Part of it."

"The part with the Arbiter."

"Also part of the lattice, yes."

"And us nearly."

"Less of that part. By design."

She stares at me. Dust coats the shaved side of her head like frost. "How?"

I try to explain about chaining mismatches. About seeing the little wrongs and making them synchronize. About Improvised Exploit working not like a spell but like—like persuading a row of dominoes that now would be a great time to all fall at once.

"So you convinced a tunnel to have a bad day," she says.

"Essentially."

"At thirty-one percent odds."

"I was rounding up for morale."

She leans her head back against the pipe and closes her eyes. "You are going to get me killed with math."

Probably. But not today.

A status notification drifts into my peripheral vision, and I almost don't read it because my eyes feel like someone filled them with sand and opinions. But I look, because knowing things is the only weapon I've got that doesn't require structural collapse.

**Exploit Successful: Fault Cascade (Local)**
**Result: Lattice Section 9-C sealed by collapse**
**Arbiter-7 Halcyon: Containment redirected. Pursuit delayed.**
**Thread +2**
**Attention: 3 → 7 Concordance Watchers assigned**

Seven watchers. I started tonight with three. Cracking the kiosk crystal got me flagged. Running got me chased. And collapsing a chunk of civic infrastructure on an Arbiter's head apparently doubled my fan club.

I also notice what the notification *doesn't* say. It doesn't say the Arbiter is destroyed. It says *delayed*. Pursuit *delayed*.

"It's not dead," I tell Nia.

"Arbiters don't die. They get reassigned." She opens her eyes. "But it'll take time to excavate through that collapse, and the fault activity will scramble its tracking for a while. We have hours. Maybe."

"Hours is generous."

"Hours is what we've got."

She pulls out her charcoal map, now smudged and torn at one edge, and traces a route by the dim emergency lighting that still flickers in this branch. "Service tunnel connects to Sector Seven drainage. From there we can surface in the Candle Market district. I know a roof cache with supplies."

"And then?"

"And then we figure out how to get you out of District Nine before they seal *everything*."

I nod, pushing myself upright on legs that feel like they belong to someone else. My shoulder has upgraded from numb to a dull, sick throb. Thread sits at 4 now, and I can feel it—a faint hum at the base of my skull, like a second heartbeat running slightly out of time with the first.

We move.

---

Sector Seven drainage smells exactly as advertised.

I breathe through my mouth and try not to think about the specific history of the water we're wading through. Nia moves ahead, checking corners with a knife in one hand and a hooded lantern in the other, its light a tight yellow cone that catches rats mid-scurry and sends them chattering into cracks.

"Question," I say, because silence makes me nervous and nervousness makes me talk. "If Nullwrights are dangerous enough for Arbiter deployment, why isn't it in any registry?"

"Deleted," she says without turning.

"Classes can be deleted?"

"People can be deleted. Why not classes?"

That stops me for three steps. Then I catch up because standing still in drainage tunnels invites philosophical and biological regret.

"The System shouldn't allow that," I say. "Classes are hardcoded. Everyone knows that."

"Everyone knows what guilds tell them. And guilds tell them what Concordance approves." She ducks under a low beam. "I ran a delivery once. Two years back. Package from a Votive Collegium defector to a Ragline safehouse. Sealed documents. Courier rules say don't look."

"You looked."

"Obviously. It was a list. Class names with incident reports. Six entries. All marked *Reclassified to Null*. All had casualty figures next to them."

"Casualty."

"Collateral damage during emergence events. The System forces a class onto someone, the awakening goes sideways, people get hurt." She glances back. "Some of those casualty numbers were in the hundreds."

I think about the kiosk crystal cracking. The alarm bells. The way the clerk looked at me like I'd become a disease by speaking my own class name.

"I didn't hurt anyone," I say.

"Not yet."

She doesn't say it cruelly. She says it the way you'd note that rain is coming—factually, practically, without judgment about whether rain is good or bad.

I hate that she's right to say it.

We climb out of the drainage through a maintenance shaft that exits behind a condemned farrier's workshop. The night air hits like a gift—cool, carrying the distant smell of canal water and woodsmoke instead of whatever we just waded through. Nia's roof cache is two buildings over: a waterproof sack wedged between chimney stones containing dried food, a water skin, a medical kit, and a folded blanket that smells like lamp oil.

We eat in silence on the rooftop, watching District Nine's skyline twitch under lockdown lights. Patrol lanterns move in patterns below. Ward-lines glow at intersections—faint blue barriers that scan anyone who crosses. The city is a trap with nice architecture.

Halfway through a strip of jerky, a sound reaches us from below. Not boots. Not horns.

A voice. Amplified by some civic broadcast mechanism I've never heard used before—a deep, resonant tone that rolls across rooftops like an evening prayer weaponized.

**"ATTENTION: DISTRICT NINE CIVIC NOTICE."**

Nia freezes.

**"A NULL-CLASS VARIANCE EVENT HAS BEEN DETECTED WITHIN DISTRICT BOUNDARIES. BY ORDER OF THE CONCORDANCE AUTHORITY, ALL RESIDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO PRESENT FOR IDENTITY VERIFICATION AT DESIGNATED CHECKPOINTS WITHIN SIX HOURS. HARBORING, ASSISTING, OR FAILING TO REPORT CONTACT WITH THE DESIGNATED VARIANCE SOURCE IS A FIRST-DEGREE CIVIC OFFENSE."**

The broadcast repeats. Then again.

I sit very still, jerky forgotten.

Nia's voice is flat. "They just turned every person in this district into a potential informant."

"They can't—that's thousands of people—"

"They can and they are. Null containment protocol. I've heard Ragline veterans talk about it. They don't need to find you. They just need to make your existence expensive for everyone around you."

I feel something cold settle in my chest that has nothing to do with the night air. Seven watchers. A collapsed tunnel. A broadcast turning my neighbors into my hunters.

Nia reads my face. "Don't."

"Don't what?"

"Whatever noble idiot thing you're building toward. Don't."

"I wasn't—"

"You were. Your jaw does that thing." She points at my face. "The clenchy hero thing."

"I don't have a clenchy hero thing."

"You absolutely do, and it's going to get you surrendered to people who use the word *erasure* as a job description."

She's right. She's always right about the practical things. But being right and being complete are different, and what I'm feeling right now has sharp edges that practicality can't file down.

"Six hours," I say.

"To get out. Yes."

"For me. What about them? Everyone who's about to get scanned and questioned because I exist in the wrong category."

Nia's expression does something complicated. "That's not your fault."

"It's my name on the broadcast."

"Which is why you *leave*. You being here makes it worse for them, not better."

She's right again. I'm keeping score and she's undefeated.

"Six hours. We move at the start of the fifth."

Nia nods.

I don't tell her what I'm planning. Mostly because I don't have a plan yet.

But I have five hours. And a Thread score that hums like a wire in wind. And the absolute, stubborn certainty that running alone is exactly what Concordance expects—and I am deeply, constitutionally opposed to meeting expectations.

**Comprehension: Improvised Exploit updated.**
**Chain interaction threshold: recalculated.**

I dismiss it, lean back against the chimney, and start counting patrol patterns.

Five hours.

Let's see what a Nullwright can do when he's not running.
