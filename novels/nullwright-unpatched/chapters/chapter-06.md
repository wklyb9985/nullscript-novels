# Chapter 6 — Variance Hearing (In Absentia)

I've been a lot of things. Thief. Apprentice. Anomaly. Civic reality threat.

That last one was new.

Sable Rook found me on the third morning at the waystation, leaning against the pump house doorframe like he'd been waiting since before doors were invented. He had the kind of smile that made you check your pockets while shaking his hand.

"You're famous," he said.

"I was famous yesterday. What changed?"

"Yesterday you were a fugitive. Today you're a *legal category*." He flicked a small signal crystal onto the table between us. It was already tuned to a frequency I didn't recognize—somewhere between civic broadcast and the static hiss of encrypted Ragline channels. "Concordance is holding a public variance hearing. Topic of discussion: you."

"Public?"

"Broadcast to every shrine kiosk and guild hall in Veyrun. Live commentary. Audience participation in the form of collective anxiety." He tapped the crystal. "I patched this into a routing ghost channel. You can watch without being watched."

I looked at the crystal, then at Sable. His smile hadn't changed, which meant it wasn't really a smile—it was a negotiating position.

"And what does this cost me?"

"Nothing today. I'll collect later."

"That's the most threatening thing anyone's said to me this week, and an Arbiter literally asked me to die."

"I'm flattered."

Nia materialized behind Sable with the silent precision of someone who'd been listening from the tall grass. "If this is a trap, I'll know before you do."

Sable didn't flinch. "I'd be disappointed if you didn't."

We set up in the pump house's back room—me, Nia, and Ilya, who arrived twenty minutes after Sable's crystal started humming. She examined it with the expression of someone inspecting a suspicious rash, ran two diagnostic passes through Fault-Sight overlay, and declared it clean.

"The routing is clever," she admitted. "Ghost relay off a deprecated civic signal node. The return path is dead—they can't trace listeners."

"You sound surprised," Sable said from the doorway.

"I sound cautious. There's a difference."

While they talked, I spread Nia's flood maps across the table and started marking exit routes from the waystation. If the hearing went badly—when the hearing went badly—we'd need to move fast, and I wasn't about to sit still and let two strangers in a distant chamber decide the terms of my death while I did nothing about it.

"Three viable routes south," I muttered, tracing charcoal lines with my finger. "Two of them cross active lattice zones."

"Four," Nia corrected, leaning over my shoulder. "There's a storm drain junction here that connects to the old floodway. Tight fit, but no lattice coverage."

I marked it. Good. Four ways to not die.

The crystal flickered, and the feed resolved into audio with occasional visual pulses—a broadcast format designed for shrine kiosks that couldn't handle full image projection. Voices filled the room, tinny but clear.

A moderator I didn't recognize opened the proceedings with the kind of formal language that exists solely to make bureaucracy sound like destiny.

"...convened under emergency civic protocol seven-three, regarding the unresolved variance event classified as Null-Mark Voss, Kael. The Concordance acknowledges two formal positions for adjudication. First speaker: Archivist-Magister Sel Corvin, representing the Votive Collegium liaison office."

Corvin's voice was silk draped over a blade.

"Esteemed council. The entity designated Kael Voss represents an unprecedented opportunity for controlled study. A Nullwright operating outside institutional suppression—the first in nine years—offers us data that no laboratory can replicate."

*Entity.* Not person. Not citizen. Entity. I noted this the way you note which direction the knife is pointing, and went back to measuring distances on the map. If I was going to be discussed like furniture, I could at least be productive furniture.

"The Collegium proposes immediate capture, medical assessment, and integration into a classified research framework. Voss is young, minimally developed, and still within the parameters of manageable variance. Every day he spends unmonitored increases his deviation index. But deviation, properly channeled, is not a threat—it is a resource."

Ilya's jaw tightened. She said nothing.

"Destruction of this asset would be scientifically irresponsible and strategically wasteful. The Collegium requests primary custodial authority."

*Custodial authority.* Like I was a building with a leaky roof. I circled a junction point on the map so hard the charcoal snapped. "Nia, what's the terrain like past this marker?"

"Mud. Then more mud. Then an exciting stretch of slightly different mud."

"Sold."

The moderator shifted. "Second speaker: Arbiter-Captain Veyr Halden, representing the Arbiter Directorate."

Halden's voice was different from the tunnel. Without the mask's resonance, it sounded almost human—measured, careful, the cadence of someone who believed every word and wished he didn't have to say them.

"The Archivist-Magister frames this as a question of science. It is not. It is a question of structural integrity."

A pause. I imagined him standing in that particular way—spine straight, hands clasped, the posture of a man who carries weight he chose to lift.

"Null variance is not a curiosity. It is a fault propagation vector. Every interaction the subject has with civic infrastructure generates cascading desynchronization events. The registration crystal fracture. The Lattice Nine collapse. The floodgate conduit failure. These are not anomalies—they are symptoms of an immune response the System itself is attempting and failing to execute."

"Dramatic," Nia muttered.

"Accurate," Ilya said quietly.

That stung, because she was right. I'd broken a crystal by saying my name. I'd collapsed part of a maintenance layer by running through it. The infrastructure damage wasn't something Halden was inventing. I set down the charcoal and listened, because apparently my own indictment was too compelling to multitask through.

"Containment for study assumes variance can be stabilized," Halden continued. "Eleven prior Nullwright cases demonstrate otherwise. Seven were contained. All seven eventually exceeded tolerance parameters. The Collegium's own archived data—which the Archivist-Magister has conveniently not cited—documents progressive system rejection in every contained subject."

Corvin's voice cut in, sharp: "Those records are classified for—"

"For reasons of institutional embarrassment. I have read them, Archivist-Magister. So has the Directorate."

Silence on the feed. The kind of silence that means someone just drew blood in a room where bleeding isn't supposed to happen.

"He's good," I said, which was an annoying thing to admit about the man advocating for my deletion. "Corvin talks like a salesman. Halden talks like someone who's already done the math and hates the answer."

"The Arbiter Directorate recommends immediate judicial erasure," Halden said. "Not as punishment. As prophylaxis. The subject's causal footprint expands with every hour of active variance. Delay is not study. Delay is escalation."

I sat in the pump house listening to two powerful people argue over whether I should be a lab rat or a deleted file. *This is what it feels like to become policy.*

Nia put her hand on my shoulder. She didn't squeeze. Just placed it there, like a counterweight.

I shook it off—gently—and stood. "Ilya, if I cross into Freehold territory, does my variance still propagate? Or does it need Concordance infrastructure to cascade?"

She blinked. I'd caught her mid-analysis. "That's... actually a good question. The cascade events all involved lattice-connected infrastructure. In theory, outside the lattice—"

"My footprint shrinks."

"Potentially. I'd need to study—"

"Put it on the list." I went back to the maps.

The hearing moved to council questions. Corvin gave three more arguments—economic projections, comparisons to early relic research, a truly impressive number of uses of the word "potential." He used it eleven times. I counted. Halden answered each with data: casualty rates, infrastructure repair costs, the clinical specifics that made his case feel less like an argument and more like a coroner's report.

"Subject Four," he said at one point. "Contained for fourteen months. Variance at containment: 3.2 percent. Variance at termination: 41 percent. The growth was not linear. It was exponential after month nine. We do not have the infrastructure to contain exponential deviation. We have the infrastructure to prevent it."

Subject Four had a number. Not a name. Fourteen months alive in a cell, growing wrong, and then terminated. Like a process. Like a subscription.

I stared at the map and thought: *I wonder if Subject Four had flood routes too.*

Nia caught my expression. "Stop."

"Stop what?"

"That face. The one where you're comparing yourself to dead people."

"I'm comparing *exit strategies.* Totally different."

"Kael."

"I'm fine. I'm planning. Planning is the opposite of panicking." I tapped the southern route. "This one. The storm drain to the floodway, then south through the reed flats. If we move at night—"

"If we move at night through unfamiliar marsh with no guide, we drown."

"Corsa knows the outer marshes."

"Corsa is a Ragline runner, not a travel agent."

"Same skill set, lower prices."

Despite herself, Nia almost smiled. Almost.

I pushed Fault-Sight without thinking, scanning the crystal's relay paths—clean, stable, exactly as Sable had built them. But beneath the ghost channel, deeper in the deprecated infrastructure, I caught something else.

A flicker. Brief. Clean text in a corrupted relay:

**HEARING OUTCOME: PREDETERMINED**
**COUNCIL VOTE: SPLIT (ERASURE PENDING)**
**MARGIN: 1**

Then it was gone—but not cleanly. My skin prickled, every hair on my forearms standing upright. My Thread score ticked up with a soft chime I hadn't asked for. And beneath the numbers, beneath the lattice, I felt something vast turn its attention toward me for one terrible heartbeat—ancient, patient, and utterly unsurprised to find me listening.

**Thread: 7 → 8**
**Note: Anomalous perception event. Source: unidentified.**

I blinked hard. "The vote's already decided. Erasure wins by one."

Ilya turned to me. "How do you know that?"

"I don't. I—felt it. Through the feed." That wasn't quite a lie. The information had come through Fault-Sight, not the audio, and I wasn't ready to explain that something had *told* me. Or that whatever had told me felt less like a signal and more like a whisper from something that had been waiting for me to hear it.

Ilya studied me with the expression of a researcher who just caught her subject doing something the protocol didn't predict.

Sable tilted his head. "If the vote's decided, this hearing is theater."

"It's always theater," Nia said. "The question is who it's for."

She was right. This wasn't a trial. It was a press release. Concordance wanted the public to see process, deliberation, institutional responsibility—so that when they erased me, it would look like justice instead of pest control.

I rolled up the maps and stuffed them into my satchel. Everyone looked at me.

"We need to move," I said.

"To where?" Ilya asked.

"South. Freeholds. We already knew this—the hearing just confirms the timeline." I started ticking off points on my bandaged fingers, because if I couldn't be calm I could at least be organized. "They formalize the erasure order within days. Once it's civic law, every Guard, every guild enforcer, every bounty hunter in Veyrun has legal cover to kill me on sight. Right now I'm a fugitive. Tomorrow I'm *vermin*."

"You're being dramatic," Sable said.

"I'm being accurate. Ask your friend Halden—he'd agree with me."

"He's not my friend."

"Then stop smiling like you're enjoying this."

Sable's smile didn't falter. "I enjoy information. Information doesn't care about my feelings."

Nia stood too, already running routes in her head. I could see it—the way her eyes unfocused slightly, the micro-movements of her fingers tracing invisible paths. "The Ragline can move us, but not deep enough. If they're deploying Arbiters—"

"They will," Halden's voice said on the feed, answering a question I'd missed. "Deployment authorization is pre-approved pending council ratification."

"—then we need to be outside Concordance jurisdiction entirely," Nia finished.

"Marsh Freeholds," I said. "I've already mapped four routes." I pulled the maps back out and spread them between us. "Nia's flood charts plus two alternates I pulled from the lattice residuals. Corsa guides us through the outer marsh. Sable goes ahead to arrange shelter. We move tomorrow night."

Silence.

Ilya frowned. "The Freeholds are lawless."

"Lawless means no Concordance claims. No class registration. No jurisdiction for Arbiters."

"It also means no protection. No infrastructure. No supply guarantees."

"I'll take hungry and alive over well-fed and deleted."

Nia studied the routes I'd marked and nodded once—not agreement exactly, but professional respect for the homework. "Old flood routes work. Some of them aren't on any current chart."

"How old?" Ilya asked.

"Old enough that the Ragline inherited them from people who inherited them from people who are dead."

"Comforting."

"Survival isn't comfortable. It's just better than the alternative."

I turned to Sable. "You know the Freeholds."

"I grew up there."

"Can you get us shelter?"

His smile shifted—still present, but with something underneath it. Calculation. "I can broker something. But shelter in the Freeholds isn't free. Nothing there is."

"What's the currency?"

"Favors. Skills. Useful bodies. Things that have value when law doesn't."

"We'll negotiate when we arrive."

"You'll negotiate when I say you're ready to negotiate. The Freeholds eat newcomers who bargain from weakness." He straightened from the doorframe. "I'll go ahead. Prepare the ground. Give me two days."

He was gone before I could agree, which I suspect was the point.

The feed had moved to closing statements. Corvin was making one last argument about preservation. Halden was silent, which meant he'd already won.

I turned off the crystal.

**STATUS UPDATE**
**Civic Designation: Variance Threat (Pending Ratification)**
**Concordance Response Level: Elevated**
**Attention: 7 watchers assigned**
**Note: Erasure authorization window opens in approximately 72 hours**

Seventy-two hours.

Three days to stop being someone who runs and start being someone who chooses where to stand. And if that sounded too noble for a seventeen-year-old who'd recently been outsmarted by his own satchel, well—even bad speeches need a starting line.

I pocketed the crystal and started packing.
