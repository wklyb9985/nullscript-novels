# Chapter 3 — District Under Glass

I spend the five hours learning that patrol routes are poetry written by paranoid bureaucrats.

There's a rhythm. Every twelve minutes, a paired sweep crosses the Candle Market junction. Every twenty, a solo scout takes the canal bridge. Every forty-five, something heavier—armored, slow, radiating that faint blue glow of active scanning—rolls through on the main avenue like a predator that's memorized the watering holes.

I map it all. Charcoal on rooftop stone, because Nia's parchment is too precious to waste on my handwriting, which she once described as "what happens when a spider falls in ink and panics."

By the fourth hour, I have a picture. Not a plan. A picture of the cage.

District Nine isn't locked down the way I imagined—walls, gates, hard borders. It's locked down *softly*. Overlapping scan zones. Checkpoint kiosks at every third intersection, each manned by a Ledger Guard clerk and a ward-plate that flashes when your civic registration doesn't match their list. The ward-lines at major crossings don't block you—they tag you. Log your face, your gait, your residue signature if you have class abilities active.

You can walk anywhere in District Nine.

You just can't walk anywhere without being *known*.

"Glass cage," Nia murmurs, reading my notes. "Walk around all you want. They see every step."

"There are blind spots."

"Where?"

I point to three locations on my stone map. "Scan coverage overlaps create interference here, here, and here. Too much data, not enough sorting. A person moving fast through the overlap looks like noise."

She chews her lip. "Fast meaning courier speed."

"Meaning your speed."

"One person, maybe. You need more than noise for a group."

"I know."

She looks at me sideways. "You're still on the noble idiot plan."

"It's not noble. It's practical. If I disappear alone, Concordance has no reason to lift the lockdown. They'll keep squeezing until someone cracks and invents a Kael Voss to hand over. But if the lockdown *fails*—if enough people move through it, if it becomes more trouble than it's worth—"

"Then they escalate."

"Or they shift resources. Lockdowns are expensive. Hobb told me that once—civic control is a budget line, not a magic trick. Every hour this district is frozen, Concordance pays for it in Guard overtime, merchant complaints, and ration logistics."

Nia is quiet for a long moment. "You want to make the cage more expensive than the prisoner."

"Yes."

"That's either brilliant or suicidal."

"Those aren't mutually exclusive."

She almost smiles. It's gone before it reaches her eyes, but I saw it.

We go to Hobb at dawn.

Not directly—nothing is direct anymore. We take a route through the condemned farrier's roof, across a laundry bridge Nia rigged months ago with stolen clothesline, down through a chimney chase that deposits us in the alley behind the grocer shop smelling like soot and regret.

Hobb opens the back door before we knock. He's wearing his apron, which means he's been up for hours, which means he's been expecting trouble the way farmers expect weather.

"In," he says. "Don't touch anything."

His back room is organized chaos: crates, barrels, hanging herbs, a desk buried under ledgers, and one very fat tabby cat named Invoice who sleeps on the flour sacks and contributes nothing to society.

Hobb closes the door, checks the alley through a slit window, then turns to us with the expression of a man who has rehearsed several lectures and is choosing the most efficient one.

"You're stupid," he says to me.

"Good morning."

"You broke a kiosk crystal, triggered a district lockdown, collapsed a section of public infrastructure, and announced to every authority in Veyrun that you're a class variant they haven't seen in a generation."

"When you list it all at once, it sounds worse."

"It is worse." He drops into his desk chair, which screams protest. "I spent last night burning three years of apprenticeship records and telling Guard clerks you were a seasonal hire I let go months ago."

Guilt lands like a brick. "Hobb—"

"Don't." He holds up a hand. "I'm not done being angry. When I'm done, you'll know, because I'll start being helpful, and that's always worse."

He reaches under the desk and pulls out a bottle of something amber. Pours a measure into a tin cup. Drinks it in one go at dawn.

"Concordance is running full-sweep identity verification," he says, voice flatter now. "Every resident. Every shop. They've already hit the east market row. Two families detained—the Parells and old Mister Josen."

My stomach drops. "Detained for what?"

"Failure to report contact with a null-mark entity." He looks at me. "Josen sold you a meat pie last Tuesday. That's apparently enough."

The cold thing in my chest from last night turns to ice.

"They can't do that," I say, and I know it's a child's protest even as I say it, because *they can* and *they are* and the distance between those two facts is where people like Josen live and suffer.

"They can do whatever variance protocol authorizes," Hobb says. "And null-mark protocol authorizes quite a lot. Suspension of civic rights pending investigation. Ration reduction for noncompliance. Asset seizure if the investigation escalates."

Nia leans against the doorframe, arms crossed. "How many families are they going to hit?"

"Every one you've spoken to, bought from, smiled at, or breathed near in the last six months, if they're thorough. And they're thorough."

I sit on a crate because my legs have opinions about standing. Invoice the cat opens one judgmental eye, evaluates me, and goes back to sleep.

"I'm leaving," I say. "That was already the plan. But I'm not leaving these people holding my bill."

Hobb's eyes narrow. "Explain."

"If I build a way out—not just for me, for anyone who needs it—and the lockdown breaks because it's too porous, Concordance has to choose between maintaining the sweep and dealing with the leak. Bureaucracies hate leaks more than criminals."

"You want to build an escape route," Hobb says slowly. "In a district under active surveillance. In five hours. While being the most wanted person in the lattice."

"Four hours now."

He pours another drink. Doesn't drink it. Stares at it like it contains prophecy.

"I know people," he says finally.

Nia and I both look at him.

"Shop owners. Market runners. The kind of people who move things without paperwork because paperwork is a luxury tax on survival." He meets my eyes. "I can get word out. Quietly. But I need to know what you're building before I put my neighbors in front of it."

I tell him about the scan overlap zones. About the patrol rhythms. About the fact that ward-lines *tag* but don't *block*, meaning the data can be overwhelmed if enough people cross enough checkpoints in a short window.

"Noise," he says.

"Coordinated noise. Enough civilians moving through checkpoints simultaneously, and the sorting system chokes. In that window, anyone who needs to actually disappear—"

"Disappears." He nods slowly. "Flash crowd. Old tactic. Union organizers used it before the guild crackdowns."

"You'd know."

He gives me a look sharp enough to cut glass. "Don't get historical with me, boy. I was young and stupid once. Now I'm old and stupid, which is the same thing with more knee pain."

But he's already pulling a ledger from under a stack of turnip invoices. Inside, hidden between vegetable accounts, is a list of names with district quadrant codes next to them.

A network. Quiet, pre-existing, maintained by habit and trust and the shared understanding that official channels are a luxury that flows uphill.

Hobb has been organizing longer than I've been alive.

"I'll need two hours to get runners out," he says. "The Market Mothers can spread word to the residential blocks. But the flash crowd needs a trigger—a reason for people to be moving. Something normal."

"Morning market opening," Nia says. "Shift change at the dye works. Temple bells for the dawn prayer. All hit within thirty minutes of each other."

"The prayer bells won't ring under lockdown," Hobb says.

"They will if someone rings them."

He and Nia share a look that communicates something I'm not fully part of—the look of people who've operated in cracks all their lives and recognize another crack-dweller.

"Fine," Hobb says. "I'll send runners. You—" He points at me. "—stay invisible. Do not go outside. Do not use your weird eye thing where anyone can see it. Do not breathe in a way that suggests criminal intent."

"That's all my breathing."

"I know. It's why I drink."

The next three hours are the longest of my life.

I sit in Hobb's attic above the shop, hidden behind crates of dried lentils and a broken loom that's been "about to be repaired" since before I was born. Through gaps in the floorboards, I hear Hobb moving below—casual, steady, the rhythms of a man opening a shop for business despite the lockdown because that's what Hobb does. He sells vegetables. He does not deviate from selling vegetables. Deviating from vegetables would be suspicious.

Meanwhile, his runners slip out through back doors and roof routes, carrying word in the old ways: whispered at kitchen windows, scratched in chalk on shared walls, folded into market baskets.

I use the time to study my Fault-Sight.

It's not just an on-off switch, I'm realizing. It's a dial. Turned low, it shows me stress lines in the immediate environment—cracks in wood, strain in metal, the places where things are weakest. Turned higher, it shows *deeper* mismatches: timing desyncs in ward-lines, probability distortions around guard patrols, the faint residue trails left by people with active class abilities.

Turned all the way up—which I try once, for about four seconds—it shows me something that makes my nose bleed.

The lattice itself. Not the tunnels I fell through yesterday, but the *structure* beneath structure—gossamer threads of logic connecting every object, every person, every rule. A web so fine and vast it makes the visible world look like a painting done over the real thing.

I wipe blood from my upper lip and dial it back to minimum.

Baby steps. Baby steps that don't end with me painting the floorboards red.

**Fault-Sight: Sustained use improving resolution.**
**Warning: High-intensity use causes physiological strain.**
**Current safe operational window: 4-6 seconds at maximum.**

Noted.

Through the attic's tiny window, I watch the district wake up under glass. People emerge from their homes—cautious, heads down, moving toward checkpoints because the broadcast told them to and noncompliance has consequences. They carry their identification slates. They queue. They submit to scans from bored Guards who check names against a list.

I see Mrs. Allard, who sells honey pastries from a cart, stand in line for forty minutes with her daughter before a clerk waves them through. I see Tommin, a kid two years younger than me who runs errands for copper, get pulled aside for additional questioning because his registration has a clerical error from three years ago. He stands there, shoulders hunched, while two Guards debate whether a misspelled surname constitutes potential fraud.

He's thirteen.

I try to come up with something funny to say about it, even just to myself, even just to take the edge off. Something about bureaucratic spelling bees or surname audits. Nothing comes. Some things aren't material. They're just ugly.

Nia appears in the attic like a ghost with better footwear. I didn't hear her come up the stairs, which is either impressive tradecraft or a comment on my situational awareness.

"Network's moving," she says. "Hobb's people are good. Market Mothers alone cover six residential blocks."

"Timeline?"

"Flash crowd triggers in ninety minutes. Market opening, shift change, and Nia Serrin's Unauthorized Bell Service all within a twenty-minute window."

"You're ringing the temple bells yourself?"

"Me and two Ragline friends who owe me favors. One of them can climb anything short of a political promise."

I almost laugh. "And the escape route?"

She unrolls a fresh charcoal map. "Three paths out of the scan-overlap zones. One leads to a condemned sewer main that exits past the district boundary into marsh scrub. One leads to a Ragline cache tunnel under the canal—tight, but passable for small groups. Third is a roof route that connects to District Eight through an abandoned tenement bridge."

"Three options. Good."

"Not for you."

I look up.

"You take the sewer main. Alone. First, before the flash crowd. The crowd covers the people who need it—families, flagged names, anyone Concordance is squeezing. You go early, go quiet, and go *far*."

"Nia—"

"This isn't negotiable. You stay, and everything Hobb built in the last three hours collapses because every Guard in the district will converge on your null-mark signature. You are the searchlight, Kael. You have to be somewhere else for the shadows to work."

I hate her logic. I hate it because it's perfect and leaves no room for the version of this where I'm heroically present for the result.

"Fine," I say. "But I'm not running to the marsh. Not yet."

"Why?"

"Because I want to do one thing first."

I tell her. She listens. Her expression cycles through disbelief, calculation, grudging respect, and back to disbelief.

"That's insane," she says.

"Is it insane, or is it structurally—"

"If you say *structurally blasphemous* one more time, I will push you out this window."

"It'll work."

"It'll work once. Maybe."

"Once is enough."

She stares at me for a long moment. Then she folds the map, tucks it into her vest, and nods once.

"Fifty minutes," she says. "Be in the sewer by then or I'm leaving without guilt."

"You'd feel a little guilt."

"I'd feel a little annoyance. Don't confuse the two."

She disappears down the stairs.

I turn back to the window and push Fault-Sight to medium. The district sprawls below, its scan-lines and ward-nets visible as a faint luminous grid overlaying streets and rooftops. And there—at the central checkpoint where Tommin got questioned, where the scan data all funnels to a relay kiosk before being transmitted to Concordance processing—I see the seam.

A tiny mismatch. The relay kiosk runs on a timing cycle that desyncs from its source beacon every 400 seconds. During the desync, data packets queue instead of transmitting. If the queue overflows—say, because two hundred people are crossing checkpoints simultaneously—

The kiosk doesn't crash. Nothing so dramatic. It just *lags*. And in that lag, identity tags go through without full verification. Names pass uncheckable. Faces blur in the record.

A two-minute window where the glass cage goes foggy.

I pull my Fault-Sight back before the headache arrives and find Hobb waiting at the bottom of the attic stairs, arms crossed.

"You look like you're planning something I'll hate," he says.

"Probably."

"Is it going to help?"

"If it works, the lockdown scan breaks for long enough that your flash crowd actually covers people instead of just annoying Guards."

He studies me. In that look is everything he doesn't say—that he's been protecting me since I was twelve, that my mother would have wanted him to keep me safe, that safe and useful are different things and he's afraid I've chosen useful.

"Your mother," he says, then stops. Starts again. "She had the same look. Right before doing something generous and destructive."

"I'm told it's genetic."

"Get out of my attic," he says, and it sounds like *be careful*.

---

The flash crowd works.

I don't see it from inside the district—I'm already in the sewer main by the time the temple bells ring, unauthorized and glorious, echoing across morning rooftops. But I feel it through the lattice. A tremor in the data layer, a surge of movement that registers in my Fault-Sight as a bloom of white noise where the scan-overlap zones should be crisp and readable.

Hobb's people. Market Mothers. Shift workers. Temple-goers who heard the bells and followed habit instead of lockdown orders. Two hundred, maybe three hundred people moving at once through a system designed to track fifty at a time.

And the relay kiosk—right on schedule, right at the desync—chokes.

**SCAN RELAY: BUFFER OVERFLOW**
**IDENTITY VERIFICATION: DEGRADED MODE**
**ESTIMATED RECOVERY: 138 SECONDS**

Two minutes and eighteen seconds of fog.

I don't know how many people slip through. I don't know which families use the Ragline tunnel, which names vanish from the queue, which flagged residents walk through checkpoints as ghosts in a crowd. I'll probably never know.

But as I wade through sewer water toward the district boundary, my status pane updates:

**Progress Event: Coordinated civic disruption via systemic exploitation (+Will, +Thread)**
**Thread: 4 → 5**

I emerge from the sewer into gray marsh light, covered in filth, shaking with cold, and grinning like an idiot.

Behind me, the lockdown horns sound again—angrier this time.

Ahead, the marsh stretches toward a freedom that smells like mud and possibility.

I have five Thread, seven Concordance watchers, one working arm, and no plan beyond the next hundred yards.

But somewhere back there, Tommin walked through a checkpoint without anyone checking his name.

That's enough for now.
