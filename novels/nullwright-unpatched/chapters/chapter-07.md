# Chapter 7 — Unlicensed Breathing

The sweep hit Hobb's quarter at dawn.

We weren't supposed to be there. The plan was to lie low at the waystation, wait for Sable's signal, and then move on to the Freeholds through Nia's flood routes. Clean. Simple. The kind of plan that assumes the world cooperates.

Instead, a Ragline runner showed up at midnight with blood on his shoes and a message from Hobb: *They're sealing the district. Come now or I lose everyone.*

So we went.

Nia led us through maintenance corridors she navigated by memory and smell—literally smell, because certain junctions had distinct air signatures based on what they vented. "Tannery runoff," she'd say, turning left. "Baker's exhaust," right. "Something dead," straight ahead and faster.

We surfaced in the back of Hobb's shop at four in the morning. The district was quiet in the wrong way—not sleeping quiet, but holding-its-breath quiet. Through the shop's front window, I could see lampposts pulsing with blue civic light, which meant the ward network was active.

Hobb was in the back room, loading crates with the grim efficiency of a man who'd done this before.

"You're here," he said. Not a greeting. A status report.

"What's happening?"

"Variance sweep. Ledger Guard plus guild security contractors. They're doing door-to-door class verification. Anyone unregistered gets detained. Anyone who resists gets contained." He shoved a crate toward me. "Make yourself useful."

I caught it. "What's in these?"

"Supplies for people who won't have supplies by tomorrow. Food, water tabs, basic medical. I've been building these kits since the lockdown."

For a man who claimed to only care about profit margins and knee pain, Hobb had an inconvenient habit of being decent.

"How many people?" Nia asked.

"In the quarter? Six hundred, give or take. Unregistered? Maybe forty. But they're not targeting just unregistered. They're using the sweep as cover for general compliance enforcement. Ration cards. Debt records. Employment verification. If your paperwork has a wrinkle, you're a target."

"That's half the district," I said.

"Welcome to the point."

We had maybe two hours before the sweep teams reached our block. Hobb's network—shopkeepers, cart drivers, a woman named Gren who ran a laundry service and had opinions about everything—moved crates through back alleys and rooftop passes while I watched the approaching blue lights through Fault-Sight.

The containment net was elegant. I hated that I could appreciate it.

A lattice-integrated detection grid overlaid the district in concentric rings, each node connected to the ward network. The rings tightened as sweep teams advanced, pushing anyone who fled toward chokepoints where containment units waited. If you ran, the grid tracked your System signature. If you hid, the nodes would pulse-scan every structure within range. The only blind spots were underground, and they'd stationed teams at every known maintenance access point.

"They've learned," I told Nia.

"From what?"

"From us. The maintenance routes, the underworks exits—they've got them covered. This grid is designed to catch people who think like we do."

Nia's expression didn't change, which meant she was very angry. "Options?"

I studied the grid through Fault-Sight, pushing deeper. The ward nodes were hardened against standard disruption—no obvious fault lines, no convenient desynchronization points. Someone had done quality work.

But the nodes weren't standalone. They talked to each other through the lattice, sharing scan data in real-time. And the communication pathways between nodes—those were older infrastructure. Bolted onto the existing civic lattice like new pipe welded to old.

Old pipe has seams.

"I can jam it," I said.

"The whole grid?"

"Not break it. Jam it. If I overload the communication between nodes, the grid loses coherence. Each node keeps working individually, but they stop coordinating. Scan coverage drops from unified to patchy. Blind spots open up."

"How?"

"Improvised Exploit on the relay junctions. I inject noise into the inter-node pathways. The nodes try to resynchronize, fail, try again, fail harder. Cascade desync."

"And the cost?"

I hesitated. "I don't know. I've never hit infrastructure this wide. Could be nothing. Could be—more than nothing."

Nia stared at me. "Define 'more than nothing.'"

"I don't have a definition. I have a bad feeling."

"Your bad feelings have a strong track record."

"That's not a compliment."

"It's not meant to be."

Ilya, who had been silent in the corner studying the amber crystal, looked up. "If you disrupt the lattice communication layer, you risk cascading into adjacent infrastructure. Water pressure systems. Heating. Lighting. The civic lattice doesn't cleanly separate its functions."

"So what? I just watch them round up forty people?"

"I'm not saying don't do it. I'm saying understand what you're choosing."

I understood. That was the problem.

---

Hobb's people reported the sweep teams three blocks away. I could hear them now—boots in rhythm, the hum of containment equipment, and the clipped bark of compliance orders echoing off stone.

Through the shop window, I watched a family across the street step outside when a Guard squad reached their door. Father, mother, two children. The father held up ration cards with steady hands. The Guard took them, scanned something I couldn't see, and handed them back. The family went inside.

Next door, a man came out alone. Older. Thin. He fumbled his papers. The Guard waited. When the papers didn't satisfy whatever they were looking for, two more Guards stepped forward. The man started talking fast—I could see his mouth moving, hands gesturing. One of the Guards produced a containment band—a metal cuff that suppressed class abilities and tagged your location for civic monitoring.

The man stepped back. A Guard grabbed his arm.

"Kael," Hobb said from behind me. "Whatever you're going to do."

I was already moving.

The relay junction I needed was beneath the street—an access panel behind a municipal water standpipe, thirty feet from the shop. I went out the back, circled through the alley, and found the panel by Fault-Sight alone. The lattice connections blazed in my vision like a nervous system exposed to air.

I placed both hands on the panel and pushed.

Not physically. Through Thread.

This is the part that's hard to explain, and I've never managed to describe it in a way that doesn't sound like either mysticism or plumbing. Thread is... you know how you can feel the difference between a locked door and a stuck door? One has intent behind it, the other is just friction. Thread lets me talk to the friction.

I found the inter-node communication pathways. Six of them, converging at this junction, carrying coordinated scan data across the district grid. Each pathway pulsed with clean, regular signals—heartbeats of a machine working exactly as designed.

I reached into the first pathway and *twisted*.

Not a metaphor. I found the pulse—regular as breathing—and shoved it off-beat. Not broken. Confused. Like pushing someone's stride off-rhythm mid-step.

The node at the other end stuttered.

I hit the second pathway. Third. Fourth.

By the fifth, the junction was screaming. Not literally—the lattice doesn't have a voice. But Fault-Sight showed me the stress: red fracture lines spiderwebbing through the relay infrastructure, signals colliding, nodes trying to resynchronize and tripping over each other's corrections.

**LATTICE ALERT: INTER-NODE DESYNC**
**GRID COHERENCE: DROPPING**
**SCAN COVERAGE: 73%... 54%... 31%...**

The sixth pathway I didn't just twist—I snapped it. Yanked the timing so far out of alignment that the signal folded back on itself.

The grid shattered into islands.

And then the collateral hit.

The streetlamps went out. All of them, in a wave that rolled from my junction outward like a stone dropped in dark water. Then the water standpipe beside me groaned, shuddered, and burst a seam—not a full break, but a steady spray of pressurized water across the alley.

From somewhere deeper in the district, I heard a transformer pop with a sound like a giant clearing its throat. Then another. Then a third.

The heating system in the building above me clicked off. I knew because I heard someone inside shout in surprise.

Ilya was right. The civic lattice didn't separate its functions. When I broke the communication layer, the desync bled into everything connected to it—water pressure, lighting, heating, probably half a dozen systems I couldn't even see.

I'd opened the blind spots. I'd also killed the infrastructure for everyone in a three-block radius.

**EXPLOIT REGISTERED: INFRASTRUCTURE DESYNC (AREA)**
**Thread: 8 → 9**
**Body strain: Moderate**
**Collateral index: HIGH**
**Attention: +4 (regional alert triggered)**

My hands were shaking. My nose was bleeding—I tasted copper on my upper lip. The Thread expenditure had hit harder than expected, like sprinting uphill and finding out the hill was a cliff and the cliff was on fire.

But the grid was down. The sweep teams would be blind—no coordinated scanning, no real-time tracking, no chokepoint targeting. For the next twenty, maybe thirty minutes, the people of Hobb's quarter could move without being seen.

I wiped my nose and ran back to the shop.

---

Hobb had already activated his network. When I burst through the back door, Gren was marshaling people through a cellar passage that connected to a neighboring building's basement—an old coal route that didn't appear on any current city map.

"Grid's down," I said. "They have maybe thirty minutes before they reroute."

Hobb didn't ask how. "Gren, move them. South route. Nia's people are at the canal junction."

Nia was outside, directing traffic with the calm authority of someone who'd been running routes since before she could legally drink. I saw the thin man who'd been grabbed by the Guards—he was rubbing his wrist where the containment band had been clasped. Someone had gotten it off him. He looked dazed, grateful, and terrified in equal measure.

"Three families, twelve singles, two injured," Nia reported as I fell in beside her. "Most are heading for safe houses in the canal ward. The injured need medical before they can move further."

"Concordance response time?"

"They'll send diagnostics to figure out why their grid collapsed. Then they'll send reinforcements. I give us twenty minutes of chaos, max."

We used every second.

The evacuation wasn't pretty. It was stumbling, frightened people moving through dark alleys with broken lampposts, navigating by Nia's whispered directions and the occasional spark of someone's personal light crystal. A child cried. Someone dropped a bag and refused to leave it. An old woman moved so slowly I thought we'd have to carry her, but she made it on her own, gripping the wall with fingers like iron.

We got them out. Forty-three people, through seven routes, in nineteen minutes.

When the last group was clear, Nia grabbed my arm. "We're done. Move."

I took one step and Fault-Sight screamed.

Not a warning. A wail. Red lines erupted across my vision, converging on the street behind us where a containment unit was deploying—not Guard, something heavier. Three armored figures with equipment I didn't recognize, moving in formation, each one carrying a device that pulsed with the same blue light as the dead ward nodes.

Portable grid hardware. They'd brought backups.

"They learn fast," I said.

"Everyone does. Go."

We ran.

Behind us, the portable grid activated with a low thrum, and I felt the scan wash hit my back like cold water. My signature lit up in the lattice—null-mark, flaring like a bonfire in a dark room.

**SCAN CONTACT: NULL-MARK VOSS, KAEL**
**LOCATION: DISTRICT 9, SECTOR 7**
**PURSUIT AUTHORIZED**

The chase lasted four blocks. We lost them in the maintenance tunnels because Nia knew a shaft that went vertical and the containment team's armor was too heavy for the ladder.

We surfaced behind a tannery that smelled like ambition had died there. Nia immediately pulled out her map—the old one, charcoal on parchment—and started marking routes that were still clear.

I leaned against the wall and tried to stop my hands from shaking.

"Forty-three people," I said.

"Yeah."

"I also broke the water system for three blocks. And the heating. And the lights."

Nia didn't look up from her map. "Yeah."

"They'll punish the district for this. Ration control. Curfew extensions. Maybe worse."

"Probably."

"Nia—"

"You made a choice. The choice had costs. The costs are real. And the forty-three people who aren't in containment cells right now are also real." She folded the map. "You don't get to save everyone and feel clean about it. That's not how this works."

"How does it work?"

"You do what you can. You carry what it costs. And you keep moving."

She handed me a water flask. I drank.

A notification sat in the corner of my vision, patient and clinical:

**DISTRICT 9 / SECTOR 7-12: PUNITIVE RATION REDUCTION (STAGE 2)**
**EFFECTIVE: IMMEDIATE**
**DURATION: INDEFINITE**
**CAUSE CITED: INFRASTRUCTURE SABOTAGE BY UNREGISTERED VARIANCE AGENT**

My name wasn't in the notice. It didn't need to be. Everyone in the district would know who they were talking about.

I'd saved forty-three people and made six hundred pay for it.

Hobb found us an hour later. He looked at my face and didn't ask what happened. He handed me a piece of bread, hard and stale, and said: "Eat. You look like a moral crisis with legs."

"That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me."

"Don't get used to it." He sat down heavily. "My shop's flagged. Can't go back."

"I'm sorry—"

"Save it. I knew what I was doing when I started stacking those crates." He chewed his own bread with the resignation of a man who'd chosen this road before and knew where it went. "Marsh Freeholds?"

"Marsh Freeholds," I confirmed.

"I hate marshes."

"Everyone hates marshes. That's why they're free."

He grunted. Almost a laugh. Almost.

Nia spread the flood map on the ground between us, weighing the corners with stones. "Sable's two-day head start is now a one-day head start. We move tonight."

"Through the marshline?"

"Through the marshline."

I looked at the map—old ink on older parchment, showing waterways and paths that hadn't been current for decades. Somewhere at the edge, past the last district marker, the line became dotted. Uncertain. Unmapped.

That was where we were going.

Into the parts of the world that the System hadn't bothered to finish.
