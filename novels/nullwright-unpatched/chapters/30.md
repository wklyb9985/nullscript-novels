# Chapter 30 — Patchbreak

The medics took Nia eleven minutes later. Not twelve. I counted.

They strapped her to a lattice-rated stretcher, loaded two bags of synthetic plasma from Halden's field kit, and carried her up through a breach corridor toward the nearest stabilized medical node. She was unconscious by then—properly unconscious, not the drifting half-sleep of a person choosing to rest but the heavy absence of a body that had spent its budget and closed the shop.

I watched her go until the stretcher lights disappeared around a corner.

Then I turned back to the root interface.

Because the war wasn't done. Because Corvin was still out there with his fragment archive and his self-granted authority. Because the cascade was stabilizing at 71% but twenty-nine percent of Veyrun's governance infrastructure was still fractured and bleeding, and the erasure protocol—disabled but not destroyed—sat in the System's memory like a loaded weapon someone had set on a table.

And because I had one move left.

One move that would cost me everything I'd built.

---

"Explain it again," Hobb said.

We were back in Node 9-Black. Ilya had set up a portable diagnostic array from salvaged drone parts—the woman could build a telescope from a soup can—and was projecting a three-dimensional map of Veyrun's governance lattice onto the chamber wall. It looked like a nervous system drawn by someone having a breakdown: bright nodes connected by tangled pathways, some pulsing steady blue, others flickering red, and a whole section near the upper districts dark and dead where the cascade had chewed through.

"Patch authority," Ilya said. "Currently, all System patch commands—updates, corrections, rule changes, class registrations—flow through a single governance trunk controlled by Concordance central administration. One trunk. One authority. One chokepoint."

"One leash," Sable said from his customary wall.

"Precisely. Corvin exploited that centralization to push the erasure protocol. He didn't need consensus. He didn't need legal review. He had emergency authority over one trunk, and one trunk controls everything."

"And the plan?" Hobb pressed.

I answered, because it was my plan, and if it killed me I wanted the authorship credit. "We reroute patch authority. Break it out of the single trunk and distribute it across the civic node network—the local governance relays that handle district-level operations. Instead of one authority deciding what gets patched, you'd need consensus from multiple nodes. No single person could push a mass erasure again because no single person would control the whole pipe."

Silence.

Halden stood apart from us, arms folded, face unreadable. He'd removed his Arbiter insignia at some point during the climb—not dramatically, not with ceremony. Just unclipped it and put it in his pocket like a man removing a name tag at the end of a shift.

"You're describing the dismantling of centralized governance authority," he said.

"I'm describing load balancing."

"You're describing revolution."

"I'm describing *infrastructure reform* with a really aggressive timeline."

"The Concordance will never allow—"

"The Concordance just tried to delete fourteen thousand people. Their allowance privileges are under review."

He didn't argue. That was new.

Ilya pulled up the technical overlay. "The exploit chain is theoretically possible. Kael's Nullwright abilities give him unique access to the governance layer's permission architecture. Fault-Sight can identify the routing junctions. Uninvited Access can bypass the authorization locks. And Improvised Exploit can—"

"Can do something I've never tried at this scale," I finished. "We're not talking about popping a lock or delaying a patrol. We're talking about rerouting the fundamental authority structure of an entire city-state's reality management system."

"While your Thread is at 0.5," Ilya added.

"Thank you for that."

"And your memory is degraded."

"Appreciate the summary."

"And you have no Anchor point because you sacrificed it in Chapter 19."

"I was there, Ilya."

She removed her glasses and cleaned them, which she did when she was about to say something she didn't want to watch land. "If this works, you redistribute authority. Concordance loses unilateral control. The System adapts to a distributed model. But the exploit chain requires you to interface directly with the governance trunk at multiple points simultaneously. That means burning Thread you don't have, and using high-rank exploit pathways that will be permanently patched the moment they detect the manipulation."

"Meaning?"

She put her glasses back on. "Meaning you'll lose them. Patchskip. Ghost Permission. Possibly Checksum Step. The System will catalogue every technique you use in this chain and harden against them permanently. You won't just spend Thread—you'll burn capability. Some of those pathways will never reopen."

The room went quiet enough to hear the lattice breathe.

I looked at my status pane.

**Thread: 0.5**
**Active Exploits Available: 6**
**Estimated Post-Chain Exploits: 2 (possibly 1)**
**Risk Assessment: CATASTROPHIC PERSONAL COST**

Two exploits. Maybe one. Out of six.

That's not a power sacrifice. That's amputation.

"There's another way to frame this," Sable said. He'd been quiet—thinking quiet, which for Sable meant dangerous. "You built those pathways by running. Fighting. Bleeding. Every one of them was a scar that turned into a tool. And now you spend them."

"Thanks for the poetry."

"I'm saying the question isn't whether you can afford it. It's whether you can afford not to."

Fourteen thousand people. The erasure protocol still sitting in System memory. A governance structure that allowed one man to push a kill command because he had the right rank and the right emergency.

I couldn't afford not to.

I knew that. Had known it since the relay terminated and Nia's blood was still warm on my hands.

"Show me the routing junctions," I said.

---

The Patchbreak Chain—Ilya's name, not mine; I would've called it something with more profanity—required seven sequential exploit interactions across five governance nodes, executed in a specific order within a window of approximately ninety seconds.

Ninety seconds to restructure the authority architecture of Veyrun.

Ninety seconds, and I had Thread for maybe sixty.

"You'll need to be precise," Ilya said, which was like telling a drowning man he'd need to be dry.

"I'll need to be fast."

"Those aren't the same thing."

"They will be today."

She talked me through it. Hobb listened with the face of a man watching someone load a cannon with his best friend. Sable memorized angles and fallback positions. Halden—Halden offered tactical input on Concordance security response times, which meant he was helping, which meant something had broken inside him that I didn't have time to examine.

The chain:

**Step 1:** Fault-Sight to identify the primary governance trunk's seven routing junctions within Node 9-Black's accessible range.

**Step 2:** Ghost Permission to spoof Concordance administrative credentials at the first junction, opening a modification window.

**Step 3:** Patchskip to delay the System's response to the unauthorized modification—buying seconds before the patch engine catches and corrects.

**Step 4:** Improvised Exploit to insert a distribution protocol at the opened junction—splitting the single-trunk authority feed into seventeen parallel feeds, each routed to a different civic node.

**Step 5–7:** Repeat Steps 2–4 at two additional junctions to create redundancy. If only one junction held the new routing, Concordance could simply rebuild around it. Three junctions made the distribution self-reinforcing—each one validated the others.

Three times. Three junctions. Three Burns.

And every step past the first would be harder because the System would be actively patching against me.

"Ready?" Ilya asked.

I looked around the chamber. Hobb. Sable. Ilya. Halden and his remaining soldiers. The root interface glowing gold behind me, the Custodian silent but present, watching through fragments.

No Nia.

No Anchor.

Half a Thread and a head full of holes.

"No," I said. "Let's go."

---

Fault-Sight hit like a migraine with a grudge.

At Thread 0.5, the visual overlay was thin—watercolor instead of oil paint, suggestions instead of certainties. But I could still see the routing junctions. Seven of them, embedded in the lattice walls like glowing tumors, each one a nexus where governance authority flowed from Concordance central down into district-level enforcement.

I picked the three that Ilya had identified as structurally critical and locked them in memory.

Memory. Right. The thing with holes in it.

I repeated the locations like a prayer. *East wall, second conduit. Ceiling junction, thirty degrees left. Floor node, beneath the shattered relay housing.* Over and over until the words carved grooves deep enough to survive whatever the next ninety seconds erased.

"Junction One," I said. "East wall."

I walked to it. My legs worked, barely, in the way that legs work when the person operating them has decided that gravity is a suggestion and collapse is a scheduling conflict.

The junction was a cluster of glowing conduits converging on a central node the size of my fist. Through Fault-Sight, I could see the governance feed—a river of blue-white authority flowing from above, carrying patch commands, registration updates, enforcement protocols. All of it originating from one source. All of it controlled by one hand.

Ghost Permission first.

I reached into the junction's authorization layer and *lied*. Not with words—with identity. I spoofed the feeling of being authorized, borrowed the resonance of Halden's nearby Arbiter credentials (he winced, sensing the theft), and pressed my palm against the node.

**AUTHORIZATION ACCEPTED (PROVISIONAL)**
**Modification window: OPEN**
**Duration: 4.7 seconds**

Four point seven seconds.

Patchskip. I shoved against the System's response clock, jamming my will into the gap between detection and correction. It felt like holding a door shut against a hurricane.

**Patch response delayed.**
**Additional duration: 3.1 seconds**

Seven point eight seconds total. I needed ten.

Thread dropped: 0.5 to 0.4.

My left hand went numb. Not the zap-net numbness from before—a deeper absence, like the hand had been gently uninvited from existing. I kept working.

Improvised Exploit. The big one. I looked at the governance feed and saw what it was—a single pipe—and imagined what it should be: seventeen pipes. Seventeen feeds to seventeen civic nodes, each one carrying authority, each one requiring the others to agree before any system-wide command could execute.

I didn't have a spell for this. I didn't have a technique. I had a vision of how things should work and the ability to find the seam between *is* and *should be* and pry.

I pried.

The junction screamed. Not sound—light. Blue-white authority feed splitting like a river hitting rocks, dividing into channels that carved themselves through the governance layer with the urgency of water finding its level.

**ROUTING MODIFICATION DETECTED**
**Junction 1: Authority feed redistributed to 17 civic nodes**
**ALERT: Unauthorized governance restructuring**
**Patching...**

The patch engine hit Ghost Permission first. Burned it out like a fuse. I felt the pathway close—not fade, not weaken, *close*. A door slamming in my head, locked from the other side. Ghost Permission, the ability to borrow credentials, to be the right person in the wrong place—gone.

Permanently.

**Exploit pathway [Ghost Permission] patched. No longer available.**

I staggered. Hobb caught me.

"Junction One complete," Ilya reported. Her voice was professionally steady in the way that meant she was terrified. "Distribution holding. Seventeen feeds active. Moving to Junction Two—Kael, your Thread—"

"I know."

**Thread: 0.35**

"Junction Two. Ceiling."

---

The second junction was harder because the System was awake now.

Not the slow, procedural awakeness of a governance engine processing routine updates. The sharp, focused awakeness of a predator that has identified a threat and is mobilizing everything it has to neutralize it.

I felt the patch engine tracking me. Felt it learning my patterns, cataloguing my timing, building a model of how I exploited so it could anticipate and close the gaps before I reached them.

The System was a fast learner. I was a slow bleeder.

I reached the ceiling junction—Hobb boosted me up, his shoulders under my feet, steady as a foundation. My hands found the node. Authorization layer.

Ghost Permission was gone. I needed another way in.

Uninvited Access. My oldest passive. The thing that let me walk through doors that said NO ENTRY. I'd never used it at this depth, never pushed it against governance-level security. But it was all I had.

I pressed my palm to the node and simply... refused to be unauthorized.

Not a spoof. Not a lie. A philosophical objection. *I am here. I am touching this node. Therefore I have access, because access is the state of being here, and I am here.*

The node flickered. Confused.

**AUTHORIZATION: ???**
**Entity class: Nullwright**
**Access level: UNDEFINED**
**Modification window: OPEN (DEFAULT)**
**Duration: 3.2 seconds**

Three point two. Less than before. The System was adapting.

Patchskip again. Jamming the response clock. But this time the door was heavier—the hurricane behind it stronger, angrier, informed by Junction One's data.

**Patch response delayed.**
**Additional duration: 1.8 seconds**

Five seconds total. Not enough. Not *nearly* enough.

Thread: 0.3.

My right ear went deaf. Not gradually—a switch flipped. One moment I had stereo; the next, the world tilted sideways into mono and my balance wavered.

I inserted the distribution protocol. Faster this time, sloppier, less elegant. Not seventeen clean channels but seventeen *rough* channels, carved with desperation instead of precision, each one functional but ugly, like emergency surgery performed with kitchen tools.

It worked.

**Junction 2: Authority feed redistributed**
**ALERT: Pattern match — sequential governance restructuring**
**Patching with prejudice...**

The patch engine hit Patchskip. I felt it go—the ability to delay System responses, to buy time in the gap between detection and correction. The door didn't just close; it was *bricked over*. Filled with stone.

**Exploit pathway [Patchskip] patched. No longer available.**

Two down.

I dropped from Hobb's shoulders. Landed badly. My ankles folded and I went to my knees on the chamber floor, and for a moment—three seconds? five?—I wasn't anywhere. Not unconscious. Not present. Just... buffering. A person-shaped loading screen.

When I came back, Sable was snapping his fingers in front of my face.

"Junction Three," I said.

"You don't have enough Thread."

"Junction Three."

"Kael—"

"I have one junction left and twenty-nine percent of a city that's still broken and a governance structure that can be rebuilt by any Concordance official with a bad day and a high rank unless I finish this chain. Junction. *Three.*"

Sable looked at Hobb. Hobb looked at me. Looked at me the way he'd looked at me the day my mother died and I'd shown up at the shop and asked for work because the alternative was sitting still and feeling everything.

"Floor node," he said. "Beneath the relay housing."

I crawled.

---

Not metaphorically. I crawled on hands and knees across the chamber floor because my legs had filed their formal resignation and my Thread was at 0.25 and the world was a narrow tunnel of gold light with darkness eating the margins.

The floor node was buried under debris from the earlier destabilization. Sable cleared rubble while I lay on the glass floor and pressed my face against the cold surface and watched the governance feed flowing beneath me like a river under ice.

One more. One more junction. One more lie told to a System that was now fully alert, fully hostile, and fully equipped with a model of every trick I'd ever used.

Ghost Permission—gone. Patchskip—gone.

What did I have?

Uninvited Access. Fault-Sight. Improvised Exploit.

And 0.25 Thread.

"Kael." Ilya's voice, close. She was kneeling beside me. "If you push below 0.1, I can't predict what happens. The Custodian's relay already damaged your cognitive architecture. Another major exploit at this Thread level could cause—"

"Permanent memory loss. I know."

"More than memory. Identity fragmentation. You might not come back as you."

"I might not come back at all."

"Yes."

I thought about that. Lying on the floor of a chamber beneath reality, face against glass, blood in my mouth from biting my cheek to stay conscious. I thought about not coming back.

And I thought about Nia, unconscious on a stretcher, who had run seven minutes through hell for fourteen thousand strangers without thinking about it.

*I didn't even have to think about it*, she'd said.

Neither did I.

"Clear the node," I said.

Sable pulled the last chunk of debris away. The floor node glowed beneath the glass—smaller than the others, dimmer, but pulsing with the same blue-white authority feed. The System's single throat.

I pressed both palms flat.

Uninvited Access. Not asking permission. Not spoofing credentials. Just being here, being Kael, being the kind of person who walks through doors because the sign said NO and I've never been good with instructions.

**AUTHORIZATION: FORCED EXCEPTION**
**Entity: Kael Voss, Nullwright (Provisional)**
**System note: This entity has been flagged for permanent removal from all access layers. Proceeding with modification will trigger immediate full-spectrum patching of all remaining exploit pathways.**

I read that twice.

All remaining pathways.

Not just the one I used. All of them. Fault-Sight. Uninvited Access. Improvised Exploit. Everything.

The System was offering me a deal: finish the chain and lose it all, or stop here and keep what little I had left.

I laughed. It came out as a wheeze.

"What?" Hobb asked.

"It's trying to negotiate."

"And?"

"I was never good at negotiating. Ask anyone I owe money."

I pushed.

---

The last insertion was agony and silence and light.

Improvised Exploit, burning like a sun in my skull, converting the last of my Thread into raw restructuring force. The governance feed splitting beneath my hands—seventeen channels carving through the authority layer, each one locking into the network that Junctions One and Two had established, each one reinforcing the others, building a web that no single point of failure could collapse.

The System patched.

It patched *everything*.

Fault-Sight went first—the red seams vanishing from my vision like someone had turned off a projector. The world lost its stitching. The cracks and seams and probability lines that I'd been seeing for weeks, that had become as natural as color, snapped to black. Gone.

**Exploit pathway [Fault-Sight] patched.**

Uninvited Access went next—a sensation like having a key pulled out of my hand, every lock in the world clicking shut simultaneously. Doors closed. Walls solidified. The maintenance layer, which had been my second home, became a place I couldn't touch.

**Exploit pathway [Uninvited Access] patched.**

Improvised Exploit held longest because it was the one doing the work. It burned bright and fierce and final, channeling the last dregs of Thread into the distribution protocol, writing the restructuring into the governance layer with the permanence of carved stone.

Then it, too, went dark.

**Exploit pathway [Improvised Exploit] patched.**

**Thread: 0.1**

**PATCHBREAK CHAIN: COMPLETE**
**Governance authority rerouted to distributed civic node network.**
**Concordance unilateral control: REVOKED**
**Single-point override capability: ELIMINATED**
**17 civic nodes now share patch authority by consensus protocol.**

**Personal cost assessment:**
**Exploit pathways remaining: 1 (Checksum Step — damaged, reliability unknown)**
**Fault-Sight: OFFLINE**
**Uninvited Access: OFFLINE**
**Improvised Exploit: OFFLINE**
**Ghost Permission: OFFLINE**
**Patchskip: OFFLINE**
**Thread recovery prognosis: Uncertain. Possible permanent ceiling reduction.**

**Congratulations. You won. You also lost. The System appreciates your commitment to mutual destruction.**

I lay on the floor and watched the gold light of the root interface pulse once, twice, three times—the Custodian acknowledging the change, absorbing the new architecture, adapting.

Then the gold went out.

Not dead. Sleeping. The Custodian withdrawing to complete its cascade stabilization through the newly distributed network, no longer needing a human relay, no longer needing me.

The chamber went dark except for Ilya's diagnostic lens and the steady blue glow of seventeen freshly carved authority feeds pulsing beneath the glass floor like veins in a new body.

Hobb picked me up.

Not helped me up. Picked me up, the way you pick up a child or a sack of flour or something precious that has made itself too heavy to carry and too important to leave. He slung my arm over his shoulder and half-carried me across the chamber.

"You're an idiot," he said.

"I know."

"You just lobotomized yourself."

"I know."

"Your mother would've killed you."

"...yeah."

His arm tightened. Not a hug. Absolutely not a hug. A structural adjustment for carrying purposes. Definitely.

I leaned into it anyway.
