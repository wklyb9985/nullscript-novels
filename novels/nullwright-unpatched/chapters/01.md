**Synopsis/Pitch:**
When Kael Voss accidentally breaks into the hidden maintenance layer beneath reality, he discovers the world runs on a living System—and he can hear its bugs scream. Branded a dangerous “Nullwright” by the guilds that profit from perfect rules, Kael must level by exploiting glitches no one else can see. But every exploit he uses patches the world against him… and something old in the code has started noticing his name.

# Chapter 1: Things That Shouldn’t Have Hit Level Two

The first time I died, I was halfway through stealing my own lunch.

To be fair, it was a very good lunch—smoked river eel, hard cheese, and a heel of black bread I had *absolutely* bought with my own money and *definitely* not lifted from Master Hobb’s pantry while he argued with a customer about onion prices. My hand was in my satchel. My mouth was already watering. And then the alley wall rippled like wet paint.

A hand came out of the stone.

Not attached to an arm. Just a hand. Pale, knuckled, and very, very angry.

It grabbed my wrist, yanked me forward, and my face met brick with the kind of intimacy usually reserved for weddings.

“Thief,” hissed a voice from nowhere.

“I prefer *resourceful*,” I said, because I panic in style.

Then the rest of the wall opened and the world developed teeth.

---

You ever notice how people talk about danger like it comes with trumpets and dramatic lighting? Like if your life is about to derail, the sky should at least turn a poetic shade of doom?

Nope.

My doom arrived in broad daylight behind Hobb’s Grocer, while a laundry line dripped on my shoulder and someone in the next alley loudly discussed beetroot quality. I had exactly four copper in my pocket, two unpaid debts, and one immediate ambition: avoid becoming *that* corpse city sweepers complain about.

The thing in the wall dragged me in.

There was no tunnel, no dramatic portal, no magical flash. One second I was in Brick Alley Number Seven—which the city planners clearly named after a fever dream—and the next I was in darkness that smelled like cold iron and old rain.

I screamed. Very manly. Definitely deep and heroic.

“Please state your access class,” said a voice above me.

I stopped screaming, mostly because I’d swallowed half of it. “Uh. Hungry?”

A pale blue rectangle appeared in front of my face.

**UNAUTHORIZED ENTITY DETECTED**
**Location: Veinline 4-C, Lattice Maintenance Layer**
**Response Protocol: Purge**

“Well,” I said. “That seems… unfriendly.”

Somewhere in the dark, gears started turning.

I’m not a scholar. I’m not a knight. I’m not even a decent apprentice if you ask Master Hobb, and he frequently does, at volume. But I know what a purge sounds like.

It sounds like heavy blades unlatching.

I ran.

My boots slapped metal grating. The dark tunnel around me pulsed with dim threads of blue light, like veins under skin. Pipes curved overhead, hissing steam in short breaths. The air tasted metallic, charged, like licking a coin during a storm.

Behind me, something clanged free and began to roll.

Not roll. Hunt.

I threw a glance over my shoulder and saw a sphere of black steel the size of a cart wheel, ringed with rotating blades that folded out and in like a mechanical flower with murder issues.

“Right,” I muttered. “Purge. Got it.”

The sphere accelerated.

I did what any calm, trained professional would do.

I tripped over my own satchel.

The eel launched into the air in a greasy arc of tragedy. My face hit the grating. The sphere screamed toward me with a rising whine.

Then my lunch hit a pipe.

Grease splattered across a glowing valve marked in neat silver letters:

**PRESSURE LOCK 4-C / AUTHORIZED USE ONLY**

The valve flickered.

The entire corridor hiccuped.

And the murder-sphere—mid-charge, spinning like a rich man’s toy at festival—froze in place for one startled heartbeat before dropping like a stunned duck and clattering harmlessly on the floor.

Silence.

Then:

**ERROR: PRESSURE LOCK DESYNC**
**Subsystem Latency: 0.9s**
**Purge Unit Paused**

I lay there, cheek against metal, staring at blue text and oily fish flakes.

“Did I just beat a death machine,” I whispered, “with lunch?”

A new prompt unfolded, lines writing themselves so fast they looked nervous.

**ANOMALY OBSERVED**
**Pattern Match: NULL EVENT**
**Candidate Tag: Nullwright (Provisional)**
**Would you like to accept this class?**
**[YES] [NO]**

I blinked.

I blinked again.

I slapped [NO].

The interface paused, then politely re-rendered.

**Input Rejected: Truth Mismatch**
**Would you like to accept this class?**
**[YES]**

“Rude.”

I hit [YES].

---

A hot wire of pain ran up my spine and exploded behind my eyes.

I saw numbers. Not written numbers—living ones, crawling like ants through cracks in stone. Every seam in the tunnel had tiny values stitched into it, pulsing in rhythm: friction coefficients, heat drift, pressure variance, failure probabilities. The world peeled back one thin layer and showed me the ugly stitching.

It was horrifying.

It was beautiful.

It lasted maybe three seconds.

Then it hurt enough to make me throw up smoked eel.

When my vision cleared, my hands were shaking. A status pane hovered at the edge of sight like a stain I couldn’t blink away.

**Name:** Kael Voss  
**Level:** 1  
**Class:** Nullwright (Provisional)  
**Core Attributes:** Body 4 | Sense 7 | Will 5 | Thread 1  
**Active Trait:** Fault-Sight (Rank 1)  
**Passive Trait:** Uninvited Access  
**Warning:** Your class is not registered with the Guild Concordance.

“Thread?” I said out loud. “What in the twelve blasted hells is Thread?”

No answer.

The murder-sphere twitched.

Right. Questions later.

I scrambled up, grabbed my satchel (moment of silence for the eel), and limped down the corridor while the unit rebooted behind me with an annoyed mechanical cough.

The tunnel split ahead: left marked **PRIMARY FLOW**, right marked **WASTE RETURN**, and a third path with no sign at all, half-hidden behind conduit bundles.

I should’ve taken primary flow. I know this now because I’m no longer actively sprinting from autonomous homicide. But Fault-Sight flickered when I looked at the unsigned path. Tiny red cracks appeared in the air itself, outlining a seam in reality like a door someone had painted over.

A glitch.

A wrongness.

An invitation.

I veered right into bad decisions.

---

I popped out of a stack of flour sacks behind Master Hobb’s back room, covered in grease, bleeding from the forehead, and smelling like cooked fish and panic.

He turned, holding a turnip like a weapon.

“Where,” he said with deadly calm, “have you been?”

“Inventory.”

He stared.

I stared.

A blue notification appeared in the corner of my vision.

**Skill Increase: Lying +1**

I coughed. “Aggressive inventory.”

He pinched the bridge of his nose. “Kael, there are two members of the Ledger Guard out front asking for a boy matching your face and criminal aura.”

“I have an aura?”

“Unfortunately.”

He tossed me a rag. “Clean yourself. Use the back stairs. If you bleed on my flour again, I’ll sell your bones to apothecaries.”

Some people say Master Hobb took me in out of kindness after my mother died.

Master Hobb says he did it because cheap labor should come in small sizes.

Both can be true.

I wiped my face, tied the rag around my forehead, and paused at the stair door. “You’re not going to ask why the guards want me?”

He snorted. “You’re seventeen, clever, and poor. Those three things are illegal in this district. Move.”

I grinned despite myself and bolted upstairs.

---

The city of Veyrun looks prettier from rooftops.

At street level it’s mud, shouting, mule dung, and somebody always trying to sell you soup of questionable parentage. Up high, the copper domes catch sunset fire and the canal lanterns mirror in black water like strings of stars. You can almost pretend the city loves you back.

I crossed three roofs, two laundry lines, and one very offended pigeon to reach my usual hide—an abandoned bell tower wedged between a shuttered chapel and a tannery that smelled like dead boots. My friend Nia was already there, perched on the stone lip with her legs dangling over a sixty-foot drop, chewing mint leaves like she was paid by the leaf.

She didn’t look up when I arrived.

“You’re late,” she said.

“You’re terrifying.”

“I know. Sit.”

Nia had shaved one side of her head this week and dyed the longer braid silver at the ends. It made her look like a storm cloud with opinions. She wore courier leathers patched at knee and elbow, plus enough hidden knives to equip a small rebellion.

I sat.

She handed me a strip of dried plum without asking what happened. That’s friendship in Veyrun: no questions until blood stops dripping.

After a minute she said, “Guard asking for you?”

“Apparently I have a criminal aura.”

“Mm. I always thought that was just your face.”

“Cruel.”

“Accurate.”

I pulled up my status pane and stared at it until the words blurred.

Nia leaned over. “You finally Awakened?”

“Sort of.”

That got her full attention. In Veyrun, everyone gets a class eventually. Farmer, Mason, Runner, Scribe, Tinker—small things at first. The lucky ones roll into combat classes, guild contracts, actual coin. The unlucky ones get things like Drain-Sweeper and Latrine Alchemist and spend their lives apologizing to their own noses.

But everyone gets *something* normal.

Mine wasn’t normal.

I showed her the pane.

She read. Then read again.

“Nullwright?” she said.

“Never heard of it.”

“Me neither.”

“That’s not reassuring.”

“Kael, my education consists of stabbing and route optimization. Nothing I say is reassuring.”

Fair.

I told her everything. The alley hand. The maintenance tunnels. The purge unit. The eel-based victory. She laughed so hard she almost fell off the tower.

When I reached the part about seeing numbers in walls, she stopped laughing.

“That sounds like deep System vision,” she said quietly.

“Like mage sight?”

“Like banned-mage sight.”

Ah.

That category never improves your week.

She tapped her thumb against her lower lip, thinking. “The guilds have teams who service old relic arrays under the city. Concordance tech. If you somehow got into one of those layers—”

“By being violently kidnapped by architecture, yes.”

“—then whatever touched you might’ve marked you. If the Ledger Guard knows, they’ll sell your registration to whichever guild bids highest.”

“Sell my what?”

“Your class rights. They own legal claim over unsponsored Awakenings in district nine.”

I laughed once, because if I didn’t I might do something theatrical and dumb. “Of course they do.”

Nia’s jaw tightened. “You need to get registered before they file hold papers.”

“At the Hall?”

“At a shrine kiosk. Smaller lines, less scrutiny.”

“Less legal.”

“Exactly.”

I checked the fading light. “Kiosks close at dusk.”

“Then run.”

She dropped from the ledge, landing cat-soft on the stair. “I’ll stall anyone asking about you.”

“By charming conversation?”

“By reminding them kneecaps are optional.”

I stood, pulse jumping. “Nia.”

She glanced back.

“Thanks.”

She rolled her eyes like gratitude gave her hives. “Try not to discover any more illegal metaphysics before dinner.”

No promises.

---

Shrine kiosks are where faith meets bureaucracy and both lose.

Picture a narrow stone alcove with a goddess relief chipped at the nose, a brass offering bowl full of stale petals, and a bored clerk in priest-gray robes stamping forms as if each stamp personally insulted his ancestors.

That was Kiosk Seventeen.

I skidded in, breathing hard.

The clerk looked up. “Closing in six minutes.”

“I just need class registration.”

“Fee is twelve copper.”

I put four copper on the counter and my best expression of wounded innocence.

He stared at the coins, then at me. “You are eight copper short of legal identity.”

“Could we do… installment identity?”

His face did not move. “No.”

I glanced at the offering bowl, which held maybe nine copper in donations.

He followed my eyes. “Don’t.”

“I was praying.”

“You were calculating.”

“Multitasking is a virtue.”

He sighed the sigh of a man whose day had already been stolen by lesser criminals. “Name?”

“Kael Voss.”

He dipped a stylus in ink and touched the kiosk crystal. Blue lines spiraled outward. “Class?”

“Nullwright.”

The crystal cracked.

Not metaphorically. A physical hairline fracture split from center to edge with a sharp *tik*.

The clerk went pale.

“Repeat that,” he whispered.

“Nullwright.”

The fracture spread.

Somewhere beneath our feet, bells began ringing—low, mechanical, not temple bells. Alarm bells.

The clerk stepped backward so quickly he knocked over the offering bowl. Coins clattered across stone.

“What did I do?” I asked.

He pointed at me with a shaking finger. “Stay there.”

“Usually bad sign when people say that.”

He bolted out the side door.

I considered staying exactly where I was for approximately half a second.

Then my Fault-Sight flared hard enough to sting. Red fracture lines crawled up the walls and converged on the main entrance. Through the door’s wood I saw silhouettes: three armed figures, heavy boots, coordinated pace.

Ledger Guard.

I dove behind the altar as the door burst inward.

“By order of Concordance law, surrender for class quarantine!” someone shouted.

“Can we workshop the phrasing?” I yelled back.

A net crackling with blue current slammed into the stone where my head had been.

Nope. Negotiation over.

I crawled, rolled, and kicked the side panel of the kiosk wall with everything I had. Plaster shattered, revealing old masonry and—thank every chaotic god alive—a maintenance hatch stamped with faded runes.

Uninvited Access tingled like static up my arms.

The hatch popped open.

I wriggled through as bolts of light sizzled behind me. One clipped my shoulder, numbing the arm to useless jelly.

I slid down a narrow shaft into darkness, hit a ladder with my ribs, and clung there breathing through pain while boots thundered above.

A voice echoed down the shaft. “Seal all exits! He’s marked Null!”

Marked Null.

I had no idea what that meant.

I was increasingly sure I hated it.

---

The underworks beneath Veyrun are a second city made of ribs.

Support beams, ducts, old transit channels, water veins, relic conduits—everything stacked atop everything else like someone tried to build order by shoving chaos into neat boxes. It leaked. It creaked. It stank. It also had exactly one benefit: nobody sane patrolled it after dark.

I am many things.

Sane isn’t a long-term commitment.

I moved by Fault-Sight pulses. When I focused, weak seams glowed red at joints and locks, places where probability bent thin. I couldn’t force them open—not exactly—but if I timed a push with the pulse, stubborn things gave way easier than they should.

A rusted grate unlatching on the second kick instead of the twentieth.

A jammed valve wheel turning one notch when it ought to be fused solid.

A dead relay sparking alive for two precious seconds.

Little cheats.

Little miracles.

Little crimes against the expected.

By full dark I reached a forgotten service platform above Canal Three, hidden behind hanging chains and a collapsed brick arch. I dropped down, nearly face-planted, and sat with my back to cold stone while canal water slapped below.

My shoulder was still numb. My stomach was empty. My heart had yet to get the memo that sprinting was done.

Status pane. I needed facts.

It responded immediately.

**Name:** Kael Voss  
**Level:** 2  
**Class:** Nullwright (Provisional)  
**Core Attributes:** Body 4 | Sense 8 | Will 5 | Thread 2  
**Active Trait:** Fault-Sight (Rank 1)  
**Passive Trait:** Uninvited Access  
**New Trait Unlocked:** Improvised Exploit (Rank 1)  
**Condition:** Shocked Nerve (Left Shoulder) - Minor  
**Attention:** 3 Concordance Watchers assigned.

I stared at Level 2.

“You can’t be Level 2 on day one,” I told the air.

The air offered no rebuttal.

A smaller notification slid in:

**Progress Event:** Survival via unauthorized subsystem interaction (+Class Growth)  
**Progress Event:** Evaded sanctioned containment (+Class Growth)

So apparently running for my life counted as curriculum.

Great.

Footsteps sounded on brick above.

I flattened into shadow. A lantern glow swept across the platform entrance and stopped. Nia’s voice, low: “Kael? You alive?”

“Define alive.”

She dropped down beside me and handed over a wrapped bundle. Warm bread. Sausage. A small flask.

I nearly cried.

“Don’t make this emotional,” she said. “I stole that sausage from a man with a tattoo that said *No Mercy*.”

“I respect your commitment to charity.”

She checked my shoulder with brisk fingers. I hissed.

“Zap net?”

“Yeah.”

She uncorked the flask and poured something that smelled like winter and bad choices onto a cloth. “Hold still.”

“It burns already and you haven’t touched me.”

“That’s anticipation.”

She pressed cloth to skin. My soul briefly left my body and filed a complaint.

When I could speak again, I told her about the cracked kiosk crystal, the alarm, the phrase marked Null.

Nia listened, face set.

“That’s worse than I thought,” she said.

“Comforting.”

“Null-marks are old law. Pre-guild. Means potential System corruption risk.”

“I’m not corrupting anything.”

“You broke a registration crystal by saying your class name.”

“Okay, but in my defense, it was a very dramatic crystal.”

She almost smiled, then didn’t. “If Concordance flagged you, they’ll escalate to an Arbiter.”

“Is that bad?”

She gave me a look.

“Right. Stupid question. How bad?”

“Arbiters don’t arrest people, Kael. They delete variables.”

Cold slid down my spine unrelated to wet stone.

I tore bread with numb fingers and chewed because fear is easier when your mouth is busy. “Then I leave the city.”

“To where?”

“Anywhere without variable deletion specialists.”

“Road checkpoints are all Concordance this week. Festival security. Your face will be on every slate by midnight.”

I cursed softly.

Nia leaned against the wall, thinking in knife angles. “There’s one place they can’t sweep quickly.”

“The underworks?”

“Deeper.”

“No.”

“Yes.”

“You mean the sealed vault levels. The ones with signs saying *abandon hope and all legal recourse.*”

“That exact neighborhood.”

“I am beginning to suspect you’re a bad influence.”

“I’m your only influence.”

Also true.

She unrolled a crude map on her knee, charcoal lines over old parchment. “Courier routes use upper maintenance. But there’s an emergency conduit here—” She tapped a point near the old floodgates. “—that drops to Lattice Nine. Mostly dead infrastructure. Hard to scan. We hide you there tonight, get you to a free enclave tomorrow.”

“Free enclave?”

“Outsider district beyond the east marsh. No guild rights, no Concordance claims. Lawless, but breathing.”

“Breathing sounds good.”

A distant horn blew—three long notes.

Nia folded the map. “That’s district lockdown.”

“Can they do that?”

“They just did.”

Of course.

We moved.

---

Night in Veyrun under lockdown sounds like a city holding its breath.

No market shouting. No tavern songs. Just patrol boots, horn calls, and the buzz of ward lines activating over major crossings. Nia and I stuck to shadows and maintenance catwalks, ducking under pipes, sliding through crawlspaces built for people with fewer regrets and narrower shoulders.

At one junction we had to wait in ankle-deep water while two Guard squads crossed above, lantern light slicing through grates. I counted drips to stay calm. Nia counted exits.

At another, we passed a wall covered in old names scratched into rust.

Mira  
Jonner  
Bree  
HALT THIS DOOR OPENS INTO TEETH

I appreciated the community spirit.

By the time we reached the floodgate conduit, my legs were shaking and my left arm tingled with returning sensation, which mostly meant pain upgraded from blunt to detailed.

The conduit door was a circular slab with six locking pins and a wheel fused by age.

Nia tested it, swore creatively, and stepped back. “Can’t force that quietly.”

I stared at the wheel. Fault-Sight woke like a cat at dinner.

Hairline red pulses circled the pins in uneven rhythm. A weak cycle, repeating every seven seconds.

“I can try something,” I said.

Nia raised a brow. “Your something tends to involve structural blasphemy.”

“Correct.”

I put my good hand on the wheel, waited for the pulse to crest, and shoved down while kicking the lower housing where two stress lines crossed.

For a heartbeat, nothing.

Then all six pins snapped inward with a clang and the wheel spun half a turn like it had remembered being a wheel.

The slab door groaned open a handspan, breathing out stale air colder than winter.

Nia whistled low. “That is deeply upsetting.”

“Thank you.”

She peered through the gap, then froze.

“What?” I whispered.

She pointed.

Inside the conduit, glowing script crawled across the opposite wall in fresh blue light.

**CONTAINMENT PATH UPDATED**
**Null Signature Predicted at Node 9-Black**
**Deploying Arbiter Unit**

I felt my blood go syrup-thick.

“They predicted us,” I said.

“Move,” she snapped.

We squeezed through as alarms bloomed somewhere far below, a chorus of chimes rising through stone. Behind us, the door began grinding shut on its own.

Nia shoved her shoulder into it, buying seconds while I stumbled down the steep tunnel. “Kael, go!”

“I’m not leaving you—”

“Then stop arguing and pull!”

I grabbed her wrist with my good hand. Together we tumbled as the door slammed behind us with a thunderous boom that shook dust from the ceiling.

Darkness swallowed us.

Then lights flickered on, one by one down the tunnel—thin blue rods awakening in sequence like eyes opening.

At the far end, maybe fifty yards away, a figure stepped into view.

Tall. Human-shaped. Cloaked in articulated plates that reflected no light. Its face was a smooth porcelain mask split by a vertical seam of white fire. In one hand it carried a spear made of folded geometry, angles shifting when I looked directly at them.

My status pane screamed red.

**WARNING: Arbiter-Class Entity**
**Threat Assessment: Absolute**
**Recommended Action: Improbable**

The masked head tilted, studying me with whatever passed for attention inside that blank face.

Then it spoke in a voice that sounded like two swords touching.

“Nullwright candidate Kael Voss,” it said. “You have introduced unlicensed variance into civic reality.”

Nia drew two knives. “He’s busy.”

The Arbiter ignored her.

Its mask seam brightened.

“Submit for erasure,” it said, almost gently, “and your causal footprint may be archived.”

I swallowed hard. “Counteroffer: no.”

Something like amusement moved through the tunnel lights.

“Defiance logged,” said the Arbiter.

The spear unfolded.

Nia leaned toward me, voice barely a breath. “Any structural blasphemy left in you?”

I looked past the Arbiter, into the tunnel walls, forcing Fault-Sight until tears burned my eyes.

And there—behind it, beneath it, woven through the support lattice—I saw a fracture bigger than all the rest. Not a crack.

A wound.

A raw, pulsing seam in reality tagged with symbols I couldn’t read and one impossible line in clean blue text:

**UNPATCHED ROOT FAULT // OWNER: UNKNOWN**

My Thread score ticked upward with a soft chime.

**Thread +1**

The seam began to open.

And the Arbiter turned, for the first time, like it was afraid.
