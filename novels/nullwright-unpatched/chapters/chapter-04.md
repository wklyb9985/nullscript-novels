# Chapter 4 — Ragline Rules

Nia finds me at the marsh edge an hour after I crawl out of the sewer, because Nia has an uncanny ability to locate me at my most pathetic.

"You smell like civic infrastructure," she says.

"Thank you."

"It wasn't a compliment."

"I'm taking it as one anyway. The bar is underground."

She hands me a bundle—fresh-ish shirt, a strip of dried apple, and a small jar of something medicinal that I don't ask about because asking about Nia's supplies invites stories I'm not ready for. I change behind a stand of marsh reeds while she keeps watch, which mostly means she faces away and offers unsolicited commentary about my posture.

"The flash crowd worked," she says. "Seventeen confirmed exits through the fog window. Maybe more—Hobb's still counting."

Seventeen families. Seventeen names that won't show up in Concordance's morning verification report.

"Kiosk has already been patched," she adds. "They hardened the timing cycle within the hour. Won't work again."

"Didn't need it to work again. Single-use miracles are my brand."

"Your brand needs a supply chain."

She leads me along the marsh bank to a culvert mouth half-hidden by scrub growth and someone's abandoned fishing net. Inside, the culvert drops to a concrete ledge wide enough to sit, and from there a rusted ladder descends into proper darkness.

"Welcome to the Ragline," Nia says. "Try not to touch anything, insult anyone, or display your class status where handlers can see it."

"You know my class status displays itself."

"Then think boring thoughts."

The ladder takes us down thirty feet to a tunnel that predates the current sewer system by what feels like centuries. Older stone, hand-cut, with chisel marks still visible under layers of soot and damp. The ceiling is low enough that I duck by instinct, and the air smells like lamp oil, wet clay, and the particular brand of human determination that only exists in places people aren't supposed to be.

Lanterns hang at irregular intervals—actual flame, not glow-rods. The Ragline doesn't trust anything powered by the System.

Smart.

We pass two junctions before we see anyone. Then, suddenly, people everywhere. A woman sorting packages by chalk mark into three barrows. A teenager rewinding rope with mechanical speed. Two men arguing over a hand-drawn map in a language I don't recognize, their voices low and urgent.

Nobody looks at us.

No—everybody looks at us once, evaluates, categorizes, and then performs the theater of not looking. I feel every single glance like a pin.

Nia stops at a heavy curtain made of stitched leather scraps. "Wait here. Don't be yourself."

"Who should I be?"

"Someone quieter."

She disappears behind the curtain. I lean against the tunnel wall and try to look like a person who belongs in illegal courier infrastructure. I probably fail. Invoice the cat has more criminal credibility than me.

Nia returns with a woman whose presence arrives three seconds before her body does. She's short—shorter than me, and I'm not winning height competitions—but she carries herself like someone who's had to make very large men regret very stupid decisions. Her hair is pulled back in a severe braid threaded with copper wire. Her eyes are the exact shade of wet slate: gray, reflective, and missing nothing.

"This him?" she says.

"Kael Voss," Nia confirms. "Kael, this is Tesra. She runs the Nine-to-Marsh relay."

"You're the null-mark," Tesra says. Not a question.

"Unfortunately."

"Concordance is offering two hundred gold notes for your location. Three hundred if it's confirmed and current." She studies me the way Hobb studies a delivery invoice—looking for damage, shortage, and reasons to negotiate. "You don't look worth three hundred."

"I've been told I appreciate over time. Like cheese, or regret."

"Nia says you need transport. Deep route, off-grid, past the marsh into freehold territory."

"That's right."

"We can do that. We've moved heavier cargo." Something in her tone suggests the heavier cargo was alive and unhappy about it. "But Ragline doesn't run charity. You want movement, you pay."

"I have four copper and an increasingly impressive criminal record."

"Keep the copper. We need a job done. You do the job, you earn the ride."

Nia tenses beside me. Barely perceptible, but I've known her long enough to read the vocabulary of her shoulders. This is the part she was worried about.

"What job?" I ask.

Tesra gestures us behind the curtain. Beyond it is a wider chamber—a proper operations room carved from the junction of three old tunnels. Maps cover every wall, pinned with colored threads that trace routes I can't follow. A table in the center holds a relay schedule written in a code I don't recognize. Three handlers sit at the edges, repairing equipment and pretending not to listen.

"Relay junction under the Ashwell Viaduct," Tesra says, pointing to a map section where three colored threads converge. "Critical node. Connects our Nine corridor to the eastern freehold network. Last two couriers who went through reported surveillance activity—hidden, sophisticated, not standard Guard."

"Concordance?"

"That's what I need you to tell me." She taps the map. "Your eyes. Nia says you see things in walls."

"Fault-Sight," I say. "I see stress lines, mismatches, system artifacts. Not—I can't read mail or identify informants by looking at them."

"Can you see surveillance seams?"

I think about it. Ward-lines in the district showed up as luminous grids. Scan relays had visible timing cycles. If Concordance planted hidden monitoring in the Ragline's infrastructure...

"Maybe," I say. "If they're system-integrated, they'll have lattice connections. Those connections create seams. Seams I can see."

"Good enough. You walk the relay junction, map what you see, come back alive. Ragline moves you east by morning."

"Just map? No interference?"

"You touch anything in that junction without authorization and I will personally ensure you discover whether Nullwrights can breathe underwater."

Clear terms. I respect clear terms.

"When?"

"Two hours. Rest, eat, stay out of the way. Nia will brief you on the route."

She leaves. The three handlers continue their elaborate performance of not having heard any of that.

Nia pulls me to a side alcove where bedrolls are stacked against the wall. "Sit. Your shoulder still looks bad."

I sit. She produces the medicinal jar and applies its contents to my shoulder with the clinical efficiency of someone who's patched up more people than a field surgeon. It burns, then numbs, then settles into a warm tingling that I choose to interpret as healing rather than nerve damage.

"You didn't mention the job would be in the underworks," I say.

"The relay junction is shallow infrastructure. Old construction tunnels, not lattice depth. You'll be fine."

"'Fine' is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence."

"Kael." She sits across from me, cross-legged, knives resting on her thighs like sleeping cats. "The Ragline is the only network that moves people past Concordance cordons without registration. If their relay junction is compromised, it's not just your escape that dies. It's every escape. Every courier route. Every package of medicine that doesn't exist on official manifests. Every person hiding from a warrant they didn't deserve."

"I understand."

"Do you? Because this isn't your tunnel collapse trick. This is quiet work. Observation. You go in, you look, you come back, you report. No improvised exploits. No structural blasphemy. No—"

"I get it. I'll be boring."

"Promise me."

"I promise to be the most boring person in illegal courier infrastructure."

She holds my gaze for a beat longer than comfortable, then nods.

I eat dried apple and try to sleep. I manage about twenty minutes of something that isn't sleep but isn't fully conscious either—a gray zone where Fault-Sight pulses dimly against the backs of my eyelids, showing me the lattice structure of the tunnel walls in abstract patterns that almost mean something.

---

The relay junction under the Ashwell Viaduct is older than anything I've seen in the Ragline.

Nia brings me through a series of connecting passages that get progressively rougher—cut stone to raw stone to something that might be natural cave expanded by human ambition. The air changes too: lamp oil gives way to a mineral smell, chalky and dry, with an undertone of something electrical that prickles the fine hairs on my forearms. Somewhere, water drips in a rhythm too regular to be random, too slow to be a leak. The stone here sweats cold.

"Junction's through here," Nia says, stopping at a narrow gap between two slabs of rock that lean against each other like drunk friends. "I'll wait at the approach. Standard lookout."

"How long should the survey take?"

"Tesra's couriers said the passage is maybe two hundred yards, hub chamber in the middle, exit on the far side connects to the eastern network." She checks one of her knives—a nervous habit she'd deny having. "Twenty minutes. If you're not back in thirty, I'm coming in."

"And if the surveillance is active?"

"Don't let it see you."

"Helpful."

"I'm a courier, not a tactician. Go."

I squeeze through the gap.

The junction opens into a corridor wide enough for a small cart, with arched ceilings and walls that bear chisel marks from an era when people built underground for reasons other than hiding. Every twenty paces, iron brackets hold the ghosts of old torches—empty now, replaced by the Ragline's oil lanterns at less regular intervals. The air here is heavier, older somehow, carrying a faint metallic tang like blood on stone. My footsteps echo in a way that makes me very aware of being alone.

I push Fault-Sight to medium and the world cracks open.

Stress lines everywhere—expected in old stone. I tune past the noise, looking for the wrong things. Not old cracks. New ones. Not natural stress. Artificial.

Forty yards in, I find the first one.

A thread. Not physical—a line of System integration so thin it's nearly invisible even to Fault-Sight. It runs along the upper wall, tucked into the shadow where stone meets ceiling, following the corridor like a vein. At regular intervals it branches, and each branch terminates in a point that pulses once every 3.2 seconds.

Scan nodes. Tiny, parasitic, woven into the lattice layer of the stone itself.

My stomach drops. Someone has threaded surveillance *through the rock*.

Not on it. Not attached to it. *Through* it, using the maintenance layer as a conduit. Which means this isn't Ledger Guard work. Guard surveillance is blunt—ward-plates, checkpoint kiosks, patrol routes. This is precision work. Someone with deep System access planted these nodes to be invisible to everyone except someone who can see the lattice.

Someone like me.

I count nodes as I walk, marking positions in my head. Five at the entrance corridor. Eight more by the midpoint. The thread branches multiply—whoever did this took their time, was meticulous, came back more than once. The nodes smell like patience.

The hub chamber opens ahead—a circular room where three corridors meet around a raised stone platform. Cold air funnels through from multiple directions, carrying the distant sound of water and the closer sound of my own breathing, which I'm trying to keep quiet and mostly failing. The darkness here has texture, layers of it pooling in the corridor mouths like something waiting.

I push Fault-Sight one notch higher despite the headache forming behind my right eye.

The hub is *saturated*. Nodes cluster thick around every entrance, a mesh of surveillance so dense it catches everything that passes through. And all of it—every thread, every trickle of data—flows in one direction. East. Toward the exit that connects to the freehold network.

Not monitoring the junction. Monitoring *who enters* the junction. And from which direction.

The data flows toward whoever planted them.

I let that settle. Standing alone in a chamber that smells like wet stone and old iron, surrounded by invisible eyes pointed the wrong direction, I feel the shape of what I'm looking at before my brain catches up to name it.

This isn't Concordance watching the Ragline from outside.

This is someone *inside* the network watching from within.

A mole.

I pull Fault-Sight back to minimum and get out. Fast, quiet, the way Nia asked. My twenty minutes are nearly up. She's waiting at the gap, one knife out, weight on her toes.

"Well?"

"We need to talk to Tesra. Now."

---

Tesra takes the news like a blade.

Not visibly. She doesn't flinch, doesn't curse, doesn't slam the table. She goes very still, and the stillness has a weight to it that clears a three-foot radius around her as the handlers unconsciously lean away.

"Show me," she says.

I recreate the node placement on her map, marking each one with a charcoal dot. Dense mesh in the hub, thinner coverage in the approach corridor, everything flowing east.

"The integration depth rules out external planting," I say. "Someone had to physically walk that junction with lattice-level tools. Multiple times. Whoever this is, they know these tunnels well enough to work in them alone."

Tesra's jaw works. "How many people walk that junction regularly?"

"On your schedules?" Nia says carefully.

"On any schedule."

Nia pulls the relay schedule from the table and runs her finger down the names. "Six regular couriers. Two maintenance runners. Tesra, you and I walk it for inspections."

"Nine people," Tesra says. "Ten, counting me."

The room is very quiet.

"The data flows east," I say. "Toward the freehold connection. Three of those couriers have eastern route assignments—right?"

Tesra doesn't confirm. She doesn't need to. Her face confirms it.

"You've earned your ride, Voss," she says. Rolls the map and tucks it under her arm. "Nia, take him to staging. I have a network to clean."

She leaves. The handlers scatter to tasks with urgent precision. Whatever furniture status they'd achieved is abandoned.

Nia walks me back to the alcove. Her expression is the face of someone who just learned that a house she trusted has termites.

"You okay?" I ask.

"Three of those eastern couriers are people I've run with. Shared routes. Shared safe houses." She sits heavily. "One of them has been selling our movement to someone, and I'm going to have to be fine with not knowing which one until Tesra figures it out."

"I'm sorry."

"Don't be. You did what we asked."

She looks at me for a long moment.

"Your fault-vision thing," she says. "It's going to make you very useful and very dangerous to know."

"Story of my life. Short as it's been."

**Subsystem surveillance detected: 30+ nodes, lattice-integrated.**
**Data exfiltration: active, eastbound.**
**Sense: 8 → 9**
**Thread: 5 → 6**

I dismiss the notification. Below detection threshold—because I was quiet, because I looked without touching. The boring approach works. I'm choosing to be annoyed about that.

---

Staging is a narrow chamber where three Ragline couriers prepare for a night run. They're checking packs, taping boot soles for quiet movement, and applying something to their faces that reduces skin reflectivity under glow-rod light. Professional. Practiced. The kind of preparation that turns into ritual when your job is moving through spaces that want to catch you.

One of them—a lean man with a scar bisecting his right eyebrow—nods at Nia. "Your package?"

"My package," she confirms. I choose not to comment on being described as cargo. The cargo industry has enough problems without my opinions.

"Eastern marsh route is compromised," Scar-Brow says. "Tesra's rerouting. We go through the deep culvert instead. Longer, rougher, but clean."

"How rough?" I ask.

He looks at me. "You afraid of the dark?"

"I'm afraid of specific things in the dark. The dark itself is fine. It's the things with teeth and agendas I object to."

"Then you'll manage."

We move at midnight.

The deep culvert is everything Scar-Brow promised: long, rough, dark, and deeply committed to testing my relationship with claustrophobia. At points the ceiling drops low enough that we crawl, packs dragging, through water cold enough to have opinions about my continued survival. Nia moves ahead of me, navigating by touch and memory. The couriers move behind, guarding the rear with the casual alertness of people who've been ambushed before and plan to never be surprised by it again.

My Fault-Sight stays at minimum the whole way. Low enough to see the tunnel's stress patterns, just enough to know if something changes ahead. Nothing does. The deep culvert is clean—no surveillance nodes, no System integration, nothing but old stone and water and the slow, patient work of geology.

We emerge three hours later into marsh air so cold it crystallizes in my lungs. Stars overhead. Actual stars, not canal lanterns, not ward-line glow—real celestial bodies burning in a sky that doesn't know or care about Concordance containment priorities.

I stand in marsh grass up to my knees and breathe.

Nia appears beside me, muddy to the elbows. "Welcome to outside."

"It's wet."

"Freedom usually is."

The couriers split off east without ceremony. Scar-Brow gives us a nod that might be respect or might be relief at having delivered his package without incident.

We're past the district boundary. Past the checkpoints, the scan zones, the glass cage. District Nine is a glow on the western horizon, amber and blue.

I should feel free.

Instead, I feel the weight of those surveillance nodes. A mole in the network that just saved my life. Thirty-plus nodes, precisely placed, patiently recording every person who passed through for—how long?

"Nia. How long has that junction been active?"

"Two years."

Two years of movement data. Every courier. Every package. Every person moved east.

"Whoever planted those nodes," I say, "they don't just know the Ragline's routes. They know its *people*. Names, faces, patterns. Two years' worth."

She's quiet for a while. Wind moves the marsh grass in waves that catch starlight.

"Tesra will find them," she says.

"And then the mole's handler has two years of data they've already sold. You can plug the leak, but the water's already on the floor."

Nia doesn't answer. There isn't an answer.

I follow her east, into the marsh, my mind already chewing on a question I can't let go: if someone with lattice-level tools and Ragline access has been selling courier data for two years, who's buying? Concordance doesn't need a mole—they have Arbiters and ward-lines and the legal authority to kick in any door they want.

Someone else. Someone who wants to know what moves through the cracks without anyone—Concordance included—knowing they're watching.

The marsh grass closes behind us, and I realize I've traded one glass cage for a bigger one I can't see yet.
