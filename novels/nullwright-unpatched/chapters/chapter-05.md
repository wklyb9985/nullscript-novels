# Chapter 5 — The Price of Registration

We spend two days in a Ragline waystation that used to be a water pumping house and now serves as a resting point for people who need to not exist for a while.

It's damp. The roof leaks in three places. The heating is a cast-iron stove that eats peat and produces smoke in equal proportion to warmth. A family of four occupies one corner—parents and two kids under ten, quiet and wide-eyed, their belongings in a single carpet bag. A man with a missing hand sleeps in another corner, his breathing the metronome of the whole room.

Nobody asks names. Nobody shares stories. The waystation runs on the mutual agreement that the less you know about each other, the less you can betray.

I hate it here.

Not the place. The principle.

On the second morning, I find a Ragline supply kiosk bolted to the outer wall—a battered metal box with a cracked crystal interface that handles basic route queries and stock requests. These things are scattered through the marsh network, maintained by Ragline mechanics who keep them running with spit and swearing.

I approach it for a water ration request and the crystal flickers.

Not the normal flicker of old hardware. A deliberate, rhythmic pulse—three short, two long, three short—that I recognize from exactly zero official communication protocols.

Then the screen clears and displays something that has no business being there.

```
KIOSK 7-M / PROMPT INJECTION ACTIVE
RECIPIENT: KAEL VOSS (NULL-MARK)
SENDER: CLASSIFIED
────────────────────────────────
You have questions.
I have context.
Meeting requested: coordinates to follow.
Come alone. Bring your sight.
────────────────────────────────
THIS PROMPT WILL PURGE IN 90 SECONDS
```

I stare at it.

Eighty-nine seconds.

Someone has hijacked a Ragline kiosk—not a civic one, not a Concordance terminal, a Ragline supply box in the middle of marshland—to send me a personal message. That requires knowing I'm here, knowing which kiosk I'd use, and having the technical ability to inject custom prompts into hardware that runs on a separate system from official infrastructure.

This is either very helpful or very much a trap.

In my experience, that distinction is mostly aesthetic.

I push Fault-Sight to medium and look at the kiosk while the message counts down. The crystal's lattice connections light up like a river delta—normal data pathways running to the Ragline's relay network, standard maintenance threads, nothing unusual. But beneath them, woven through the deprecated relay paths that the kiosk's builders probably forgot existed, a second set of connections pulses. Clean. Precise. Routed through infrastructure so old it predates the Ragline itself.

Whoever sent this didn't hack the kiosk. They used a door that was always there—just one nobody else could see.

The injection burns clean as it purges. No residue in the lattice. No trace in the standard data pathways. Like a ghost stepping through a wall and the wall not noticing.

I memorize the coordinates as they appear on the next line—a location marker keyed to old survey maps, not modern district grids. Then the screen clears to a cheerful ration menu.

Professional. I'm either about to meet someone very useful or very dangerous.

I go find Nia.

---

"No," she says.

"You haven't heard—"

"You have that look. The one that means someone sent you a mysterious message and you're going to walk toward it like a moth with a death wish."

"That's oddly specific."

"It happens to you a lot."

"It's a meeting request. Coordinates in the marsh."

"From who?"

"Classified."

"Absolutely not."

"The sender injected a forged prompt into a Ragline kiosk. That's not Guard capability. It's not standard Concordance, either—they'd use civic infrastructure, not rogue supply boxes. And the injection method—I watched it through Fault-Sight. They routed through deprecated relay paths that predate the Ragline. That's not brute force. That's someone who understands the System at a level I've never seen."

Nia processes this while sharpening a knife, which is her version of fidgeting. "Or it's someone who *wants* you to think they can't be monitored. Trap dressed as opportunity."

"Possible. But the coordinate is open ground—marsh flat, no structures, visible approach from every direction. Worst possible ambush terrain."

"Unless they have aerial capability."

"In the marsh?"

"I'm being thorough."

"You're being paranoid."

"Paranoid is how I'm still alive." She sheathes the knife. "I'm coming with you."

"The message said alone."

"Messages say lots of things. I'll be out of sight. If it goes wrong, you'll hear me before you see me."

This is not negotiable. I recognize the set of her jaw. It's the same jaw that preceded every dangerous decision she's made since I met her, which is all of them.

"Fine. But stay back far enough that my guest doesn't spook."

"Your *guest*. You're already treating this like a social call."

"I'm an optimist."

"You're a catastrophe in boots."

The coordinates lead to a stone waymarker in a flat expanse of marsh grass, two miles east of the pumping station. Old survey pillar, waist-high, carved with faded directional symbols that haven't been relevant since before the canal system was built. The kind of landmark that exists because nobody's bothered to remove it.

I arrive at the specified time—noon, when the marsh light is flat and gray and hides nothing—and sit on the waymarker's base to wait. Nia is somewhere behind me in the tall grass, invisible and armed, which is her natural state.

Fault-Sight runs at minimum. The marsh is quiet—no System integration this far from district infrastructure, no lattice nodes, no surveillance seams. Just earth, water, grass, and the occasional bird with strong opinions about territory.

After eleven minutes, a figure approaches from the northeast. Walking, not hurrying, following a path through the grass that suggests familiarity with the terrain.

Woman. Late twenties. Dark hair cut practical and short. Wearing a long coat that doesn't match any uniform I recognize—neither Guard gray nor guild livery nor Ragline patchwork. Clean, precise, functional. The coat has pockets in unusual places, the kind designed for tools rather than fashion.

She stops ten feet away and regards me with eyes that catalog.

"Kael Voss," she says. Not a question.

"That's what everyone keeps telling me. I'm starting to believe it."

"My name is Ilya Quen. Former System Architect, Votive Collegium. I left—or was removed, depending on which report you read—eighteen months ago."

"What'd you do, insult someone's thesis?"

"I discovered records the Collegium preferred to remain undiscovered. The kind of records that make institutions reclassify researchers as security threats." She doesn't smile. She states it the way you'd state a weather report. "I sent the kiosk prompt. The injection routes through deprecated relay paths I mapped during my tenure."

"You're a System Architect who hacks supply kiosks in marshland."

"I'm a System Architect who hacks whatever is necessary to avoid the people I used to work for." A pause. "You have questions about your class."

"I have questions about everything. My class, the Arbiter, the fact that a kiosk crystal shattered when I said my own name—take your pick."

"Start with your class. The rest follows."

I study her. Fault-Sight at minimum shows nothing unusual—no System artifacts, no hidden surveillance, no lattice connections. She reads as an ordinary person standing in a marsh. Which either means she's clean or she's good enough to mask from my sight.

Either way, she came alone to an open marsh to talk to the most wanted person in the lattice. That's either conviction or insanity, and the Venn diagram of those two is basically a circle.

"Why contact me?" I ask.

"Because you're a Nullwright. And Nullwright classification has been systematically erased from every record the Concordance controls."

"Erased," I repeat. "Not just unregistered."

"There's a difference. Unregistered means the System created a class that hasn't been catalogued yet. That happens—rare, but documented. Erased means the class *was* catalogued. Was studied. And then every record of its existence was deliberately removed. Including the people who bore it."

"Removed how?"

"Containment. Reclassification under false class names. And in at least four cases I found before my access was revoked—judicial erasure."

Judicial erasure. I think of the Arbiter's mask, the two-sword voice, the phrase *submit for erasure*. Not a threat. A job description.

"You said *at least four*. How many total?"

"Eleven Nullwrights in the records I accessed. Over sixty years. Seven were contained and reclassified. Two disappeared—no explanation. One died during containment, though the report uses the word *collapsed*, which I think means a lattice event. One escaped entirely. No subsequent records."

"So out of eleven, one person made it out."

"Possibly. Or they died somewhere the records don't cover."

"You're a real comfort, Ilya."

"I'm not here to comfort you. I'm here because you're operating blind and that gets Nullwrights killed."

Fair. Blunt, but fair.

"Why erase the whole class?" I ask. "If they can contain individual Nullwrights, why scrub the category?"

"Because Nullwright interaction with the maintenance layer doesn't just create anomalies. It reveals anomalies that were already there." She reaches into one of her coat pockets and produces a small, flat crystal—not a kiosk crystal, something older, with a faintly amber tint. "The governance layer—class rights, registration law, permission structures—was not part of the original System design."

"Wait. The governance layer was—"

"Added later. Imposed. The original System was adaptive. Self-correcting. It created classes based on observed behavior, not institutional permission. The governance layer converted it from a mirror into a cage."

I let that land. I think about the kiosk crystal cracking—the registration system recoiling from a class it should have been able to process. Not because the System rejected me. Because the governance overlay didn't recognize what the System underneath was doing.

"So when I exploit a fault—"

"You're not breaking the System. You're using it the way it was meant to work, before the overlay locked it down. And Concordance can't have people knowing the lock exists."

"Because then people might start asking who installed it."

"Precisely."

I laugh. I can't help it. "I fell through a wall chasing stolen lunch, and accidentally became evidence of institutional fraud. This is the worst origin story in history."

"It's also the most accidental, which may be why you're still alive. The others were identified early. Studied. You emerged outside any institutional context."

She holds up the amber crystal. "This contains partial records from eight of the eleven documented Nullwrights. Behavioral data. Ability progression. Researcher notes."

"And you're offering this because—"

"Because I want to study your progression. Document what happens when a Nullwright develops without suppression protocols. You would be the first in at least nine years."

There it is. Everyone has their price tag.

"You want me to be your research subject."

"I want to understand what you are. And I believe that understanding helps you as much as me. You're operating on instinct and improvisation. You survived the Arbiter on thirty-one percent odds."

"Rounding up."

"That's not sustainable. I know what happened to the eleven before you. Eight hit limits they didn't know existed."

"And the System swallowed them."

"Yes."

I look at the amber crystal in her hand. Eight records. Eight people who were where I am, saw what I see.

"I'll work with you," I say. "Not for you. No formal arrangement, no ownership of my class data. You share what you know. I let you observe what I do. Either of us walks away when it stops being useful."

"Those terms are imprecise."

"They're non-negotiable. I've spent my entire life being categorized by people who think putting a name on me gives them a claim. I'm not trading one cage for a politer one."

She studies me. I can see the academic weighing the imperfection against the alternative, which is nothing.

"Acceptable," she says.

She holds out the crystal. I take it. It's warm—not from her hand, from inside, a faint heat that pulses against my palm.

**Item Acquired: Partial Nullwright Archive (Amber Crystal)**
**Contents: 8 case records, behavioral data, researcher notes**
**Classification: ERASED / CONTRABAND**

"One more thing," Ilya says. "The records reference something in the deeper maintenance layer. The researchers used different names for it—Legacy Process, Root Custodian. The Nullwrights who encountered it reported clean messages appearing in corrupted spaces. Text that shouldn't exist."

My blood goes cold. **UNPATCHED ROOT FAULT // OWNER: UNKNOWN.**

"You've seen it," she says, reading my face.

"Once. During the tunnel collapse. I thought it was just—lattice debris. Error text."

"It isn't. Don't seek it out. Don't respond to its prompts. Not yet." She buttons her coat against the marsh wind. "I'll contact you through the kiosk network. Three short, two long, three short—my pulse signature."

"How do I know it's not being replicated?"

"It can't be. The signature interacts with the deprecated relay paths at a frequency that automated systems don't monitor. If the pattern is wrong, even slightly, the relay paths reject it."

She turns and walks northeast. Within a minute the marsh grass swallows her entirely.

Nia materializes from the grass. "I heard everything."

"You were supposed to be out of earshot."

"I have excellent ears and poor boundaries." She falls into step beside me as we head back. "You trust her?"

"I trust that she needs something from me and can't get it if I'm dead. That's not trust. It's aligned self-interest."

"Smart."

"I'm learning. Slowly. Mostly by almost dying."

We walk in silence for a bit. I pull the amber crystal from my pocket and hold it up to the flat marsh light. It glows faintly. Eight lives in here. Eight people who were where I am and didn't make it.

"Nia?"

"Yeah?"

"I need you to teach me how the Ragline network actually works. Not the routes. The structure. Who reports to whom, how information flows, where the chokepoints are."

She gives me a look. "Why?"

"Because every system has fault lines. And I can't see the ones that matter if I don't understand the architecture."

She's quiet for ten steps. Fifteen.

"You're not just running anymore," she says.

"No."

"Good." She adjusts her pack strap. "Running was getting boring anyway."
