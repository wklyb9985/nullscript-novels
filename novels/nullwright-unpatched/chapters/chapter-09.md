# Chapter 9 — Freehold Welcome

The Marsh Freeholds looked like someone had shaken a city until the buildings fell out and let them land wherever.

Structures leaned against each other like drunks sharing a wall. Walkways of lashed timber connected rooftops over channels of slow brown water. Smoke rose from chimneys made of salvaged pipe and hammered tin. Laundry hung between structures on ropes strung so densely that entire streets existed in perpetual damp shade.

It was ugly, chaotic, and deeply, aggressively alive.

We entered through what Corsa called the South Gate, which was really just a gap between two listing warehouses where someone had hung a sign reading **WELCOME TO FREEDOM / WEAPONS VISIBLE PLEASE / NO CONCORDANCE SCRIP ACCEPTED**. A pair of guards in mismatched armor checked us for lattice-active devices—there were none, because we'd crossed from a jurisdiction that wanted us dead—and waved us through with the indifference of people who saw refugees every week.

"Keep your hands in your pockets," Nia murmured.

"My hands are wrapped in bloody rags."

"Exactly. Don't advertise injury. Weakness is currency here, and not the kind you want to spend."

"So hide the injury or weaponize it. Got it. I'll start a sympathy racket by lunch."

"I'm going to pretend you didn't say that."

Corsa led us through the first district—a market quarter that made Veyrun's most chaotic bazaars look like organized libraries. Stalls sold everything from dried fish to salvaged System crystals to unlicensed class-boost tonics that probably contained more alcohol than alchemy. A man in a fur-lined coat shouted prices for information brokering. A woman with ritual scars on her forearms offered protective wards drawn in something that looked uncomfortably like blood.

Nobody asked our names. Nobody cared.

At the market's center, Sable Rook was waiting.

He sat on an overturned crate, eating something wrapped in a leaf with the casual grace of a man who'd been expecting us and was mildly disappointed we'd taken so long. He'd changed clothes since the waystation—Freehold fashion now, layered and practical, with a Signal Weaver's comm crystal hanging openly on a chain around his neck.

"You look terrible," he said to me.

"I fought an Arbiter."

"I heard. News travels fast in the marsh. Apparently you opened a root fault at the Millwater Crossing and gave Halden a heart attack."

"I didn't give him a heart attack. I gave him a strategic surprise."

"Same thing, when you're the one surprised." He stood, brushing crumbs from his coat. "I've arranged shelter. Temporary. There are conditions."

"There are always conditions."

"You're learning." He led us through the market, cutting through alleys so narrow I could touch both walls. "The Freeholds operate on favor economics. No central authority, no taxation, no civic services. Everything is negotiated between councils, guilds, and individuals. If you want food, you trade. If you want shelter, you owe. If you want protection—"

"Let me guess. We owe more."

"Protection is the most expensive commodity in a place without laws." He stopped at a reinforced door set into a stone building that looked slightly less drunk than its neighbors. "This is Blackmoss Hall. It's run by a council elder named Reva Talsh. She's offering two rooms, meals, and non-aggression status for the group."

"In exchange for?"

"She wants a favor from me, which I'm burning to get you in. That covers the first three days. After that, she wants something from you specifically."

"What?"

"She hasn't decided yet. That's how it works here. You accept an open favor, and the creditor chooses when and how to collect."

"That's indentured servitude with better branding."

Sable's smile thinned. "That's the Freeholds. Freedom isn't free. It's just priced differently."

I looked at the door. Looked at my bandaged hands. Looked at my group—Nia tense and scanning, Ilya calculating, Hobb leaning against a wall with the expression of a man conserving energy for whatever came next, Corsa already fading back toward the market with a wave that said *my part's done.*

We needed shelter. We needed food. My hands needed treatment that wasn't torn pack lining. And the alternative was sleeping in marsh mud while my Thread recovered and my body remembered what it felt like to not be on fire.

"Three days free. Then an open favor," I said. "Does the favor have limits?"

"It can't violate your physical safety or require you to leave the Freeholds. Standard terms."

"Standard? This happens often enough to have *standard terms*?"

"Welcome to the marsh."

I pushed the door open.

Blackmoss Hall was a boarding house built on the bones of something older—stone walls thick enough to stop arrows, doorframes carved with symbols I didn't recognize, a central fireplace big enough to roast a horse. The interior was clean, which was the biggest surprise. Whatever else the Freeholds lacked, Reva Talsh ran a tight operation.

She met us in the common room—a broad woman in her fifties with silver-threaked dark hair and the kind of steady gaze that made you feel like you'd already been measured and were waiting for the verdict.

"Sable's guests," she said. Not warmly. Not coldly. Transactionally.

"Reva Talsh?" I extended a bandaged hand, then retracted it when I realized that was a terrible idea.

She noted the retraction. Noted the bandages. Noted everything, probably down to the thread count of my shirt.

"Two rooms. Meals at common hours. Medical supplies in the back cabinet—help yourself. The non-aggression status means no one in my territory will move against you while you're registered here. Outside my territory, you're on your own."

"How big is your territory?"

"Six blocks. Everything between the South Gate and the Canal Ward marker. Past that, different councils, different rules."

"And the open favor?"

"I'll decide when I know what you're worth." She turned and walked away, conversation over.

Nia watched her go. "I like her."

"You like everyone who's slightly threatening."

"I have a type."

Hobb was already inspecting the rooms. He returned with a qualified grunt. "Dry. Beds have frames. There's a window that opens. I've slept in worse."

"Glowing review."

"I've also slept in better, but those places didn't come with open-ended debt obligations, so let's call it a lateral move."

Ilya found the medical supplies and set about treating my hands with the focused intensity of someone who needed a task. The burns were worse than I'd thought—not just blisters but deep tissue irritation from Thread exposure, the kind of damage that happened when you channeled raw System energy through flesh that wasn't built for it.

"You need to rest," she said, wrapping clean bandages. "No Fault-Sight. No Thread use. Your channels are inflamed."

"My what are what?"

"The pathways Thread travels through your body. They're not physical structures—they're System-adjacent connections that map to your nervous system. You overloaded them at the crossing. If you push again before they recover, you risk permanent damage."

"Define permanent."

"Reduced Thread capacity. Sensory degradation. Possible loss of Fault-Sight functionality."

"So don't use my one survival tool. Great. What's next, don't breathe?"

"For seventy-two hours. Then we reassess."

I didn't argue because she was right and because arguing with Ilya was like arguing with a wall that had citations.

On the second day, I explored.

Not far—Nia shadowed me with the unsubtle dedication of a bodyguard who'd decided that my judgment couldn't be trusted, which was fair. We walked Reva's six blocks, learning the geography the way you learn any new cage: where the walls are, where the doors are, and which walls are actually doors if you push hard enough.

The Freeholds weren't what I'd expected.

I'd imagined... I don't know. Some kind of rough paradise. People living free, building their own rules, outside the System's reach. And on the surface, that's what it looked like. No class registration. No Concordance oversight. No Arbiters patrolling the walkways. People used whatever skills they had without asking permission or paying a guild for the right to exist.

But the underneath was different.

At a food stall near the canal, I watched a man buy bread with a brass token stamped with a council elder's sigil. Not coin. Not barter goods. A favor token—proof that he'd done work for someone with authority, convertible to goods at rates set by... the authority figure who'd issued it.

"That's just money with extra steps," I said to Nia.

"It's worse than money. Money is anonymous. Favor tokens track who earned them, who spent them, and who holds the debt. It's a ledger of obligation."

"Sounds like something."

"Sounds like exactly what we left."

At the canal junction, a dispute between two craftsmen over workshop space was settled not by any kind of court but by a council enforcer—a large man with tattoos on his neck and a club on his belt—who listened to both sides for roughly thirty seconds and then assigned the space to whichever craftsman had more favor credit with the local elder.

The loser protested. The enforcer put a hand on his club. The loser stopped protesting.

"Justice," I muttered.

"Arbitration," Nia corrected. "Different word, same boot."

In a Concordance district, the boot was polished and came with paperwork. Here, the boot was muddier but landed just as hard.

I found the pattern as we walked. The Freeholds had no central government, but they had power structures. Council elders controlled territory, resources, and the favor economy. Favor tokens were the currency of survival. If you wanted food, shelter, medical care, or protection, you needed tokens—and tokens came from working for whoever controlled them.

It was freedom in the same way that swimming in the ocean was freedom: nobody told you where to go, but the currents had opinions.

As we turned back toward Blackmoss Hall, I caught something that made me stop mid-stride.

Fault-Sight flickered—brief, unbidden, despite Ilya's orders. A pulse of awareness that lasted maybe half a second. Just long enough to see a gossamer thread of fresh lattice energy strung along the roofline of the building across the street. Not Freehold infrastructure. Not old. *Concordance signature*, faint as a whisper, threaded through the eaves like a spider's silk.

Someone was watching. From inside the supposedly jurisdiction-free Freeholds.

I blinked and the flicker died, leaving the headache Ilya had warned me about. But I'd seen it.

"What?" Nia said. She'd caught my hesitation.

"Nothing. Headache." I kept walking. But I spent the rest of the afternoon checking rooflines from the corners of my eyes, and I didn't see the thread again. Which meant either I'd imagined it or it was designed to be seen only once—a tripwire, not surveillance.

Either way: we weren't as invisible as we thought.

That evening, Sable found me on the Blackmoss Hall roof, where I'd gone to think. The marsh spread out in every direction—brown water, reed thickets, distant smoke, and the occasional light of a settlement on a rise. No copper domes. No canal lanterns. Just the raw geography of a place that belonged to itself.

"You're brooding," he said, climbing up beside me.

"I'm *assessing*."

"You're brooding. I grew up here, remember? I know the face people make when they realize the Freeholds aren't what they hoped."

"I didn't hope for anything specific."

"Liar. Everyone who crosses the marshline hopes for something. Usually freedom. Usually they don't know what that word means until they get here and find out it means 'nobody's going to help you for free.'"

"It's just—" I stopped. Tried again. "In Veyrun, the coercion is visible. It has a name. Concordance. Arbiters. Ledger Guard. You can point at it and say *that's the thing hurting me.* Here—"

"Here the coercion is distributed. Decentralized. Every elder, every council, every favor-holder has a little piece of it. Nobody has enough to look like a tyrant, but together they add up to the same thing."

"You grew up in this."

"I did. And I left. And I came back. And I'll probably leave again." He traced a pattern on the rooftop with his finger—idle, meaningless, or maybe not. "The Freeholds are useful. They're not good. Learn the difference fast."

"What's the difference?"

"Useful means you can survive here long enough to do what you actually need to do. Good means you could build a life you'd choose. The Freeholds are the first thing. They were never the second."

I thought about Hobb's quarter. The forty-three people we'd evacuated. The six hundred paying for it. The ration reduction notice with my unnamed name all over it.

"Sable. Reva's open favor—what's she likely to ask?"

"Something that leverages your unique abilities. You're a Nullwright. That's rare enough to be valuable and dangerous enough to be interesting. She'll want a demonstration, a service, or a weapon test."

"I'm not a weapon."

"Tell her that. See if she cares." He stood, stretching. "Get some rest. Your hands look like you punched a furnace."

"I punched something worse."

"I know. That's why Reva's interested." He dropped off the roof with the casual athleticism of someone who'd grown up climbing things that weren't meant to be climbed. "Three days goes fast, Kael. Have a plan before the favor comes due."

I stayed on the roof a while longer. The marsh wind smelled like water and distance and the absence of walls.

My status pane hovered, patient as always.

**Thread: 12 (volatile — stabilizing)**
**Body: 3 → 4 (recovery in progress)**
**Condition: Channel inflammation (reducing)**
**Location: Marsh Freeholds (no Concordance jurisdiction)**
**Attention: 11 watchers (unable to operate in current territory)**

Eleven watchers. *Unable to operate.* The pane said so. But the lattice thread I'd seen on the roofline said otherwise—or at least said that someone was testing the boundaries.

Halden wasn't the type to accept jurisdictional limits as permanent obstacles. He'd find a way. He'd negotiate, pressure, or simply wait until we had to leave. Because the Freeholds were temporary—Sable was right about that. You could survive here. You couldn't win from here.

Somewhere I'd need to stop running and start building something that could push back. Not just me—everyone. Nia, Ilya, Hobb, the forty-three people who'd escaped the sweep, the unnamed thousands still living under a System that sold their own classes back to them.

But that was tomorrow's problem.

Below me, through the floorboards, I heard Hobb teaching Nia a card game with rules that seemed to change every hand. Her laughter—rare, startled, genuine—drifted up through the cracks. Hobb's gruff voice: "That's not how sevens work." Nia: "You changed the rules two hands ago." Hobb: "I changed them *back*. Pay attention."

I flexed my bandaged hands. They hurt. Everything hurt.

But the sound of those two—the curmudgeon and the knife artist, arguing over invented card rules in a borrowed room in a crooked city—was the closest thing to home I'd heard in weeks.

I held onto it the way you hold onto a rope in dark water.
