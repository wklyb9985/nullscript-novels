# Chapter 28 — Integration Request

I woke up knowing seven things.

My name was Kael Voss. I was in Node 9-Black. Nia was holding me. I was cold. My Thread was at 3.1. I had broken something important. And something very old was trying to crawl inside my skull.

Seven things. That used to feel like a small number.

Now it felt like a kingdom.

---

The reconnection had changed the root chamber. Where before it had been dark metal and diminished blue, now veins of gold threaded through every surface—thin, hesitant, but *living*. The crystal array cycled through colors that hadn't existed here in decades: amber, soft green, a warm red that pulsed like a heartbeat finding its rhythm.

The Custodian was thinking again. Not fully. But enough to matter.

I could feel it.

That was the problem.

Not through the root interface. Not through text or voice. Through *me*. The lock removal had opened a channel between the Custodian's root processes and my Nullwright architecture—a resonance pathway that hummed in the back of my consciousness like a song playing in another room. I couldn't hear the words, but I felt the melody. Vast. Complex. Hungry.

"Kael." Ilya's voice, close and clinical. "Your Thread signature is fluctuating. Not dropping—oscillating. Something is interacting with your cognitive architecture from outside."

"I know," I said. "I can feel it."

"Feel what, exactly?"

"It's like..." I searched for language. My vocabulary felt smaller than it should. Gaps where words used to live. "Like standing next to a bonfire. You're not burning, but the heat is there. Constant. Getting closer."

"The Custodian."

**"I am not trying to intrude,"** the voice said from the air. Clearer now. Richer. The restored eight percent had given it depth, texture, something approaching personality rather than pure function. **"The channel is a consequence of the lock removal. Your Thread and my root processes are running on adjacent frequencies. Proximity creates bleed."**

"Define bleed," Nia said. She was on one knee beside me, the brass disc pressed to my wrist, my hand in hers. Her voice carried the tone of someone asking a surgeon exactly how big the knife was.

**"Involuntary cognitive overlap. Kael perceives fragments of my processing. I perceive fragments of his identity. At current levels, it is manageable—background noise. Disorienting but not dangerous."**

"At current levels," Ilya repeated.

**"Yes."**

"And if levels increase?"

The Custodian didn't answer immediately. The golden threads in the chamber pulsed—a rhythm I recognized because I'd felt it in my own chest. Its heartbeat. Or the thing that served as one.

**"I should explain what I am asking."**

"Nobody's asking you to ask anything," Nia said.

**"I am asking anyway."**

---

The crystal array shifted. The colors deepened. Text appeared in the air—not the terse system notifications I'd grown used to, but something more deliberate. Written with care. Presented like a document.

**INTEGRATION REQUEST**
**Source: Custodian of Unpatched States (8.3% functional)**
**Target: Kael Voss, Nullwright (Thread 3.1)**
**Classification: Full Consciousness Bridge**

**Summary:**
**Partial reconnection has restored basic cascade intervention capability. However, the accelerating root failure initiated by Archivist-Magister Corvin requires processing power beyond current restored capacity.**

**Full integration—a complete consciousness bridge between Custodian root processes and Nullwright cognitive architecture—would restore approximately 60-70% functional capacity. This would enable:**
**— Complete cascade stabilization**
**— Upper lattice governance restoration**
**— Defensive countermeasures against resonance weaponry**
**— Potential system-wide reform implementation**

**Cost to Nullwright host:**
**— Identity boundary dissolution (temporary to permanent)**
**— Memory architecture merger (reversibility uncertain)**
**— Consciousness priority conflict (Custodian processing may override host personality)**
**— Thread consumption (total)**

**Probability of host identity preservation post-integration: 23-41%**

I read the numbers.

Read them again.

Twenty-three to forty-one percent chance of still being me afterward.

"No," Nia said.

"I haven't said anything yet."

"You're *considering* it. I can see it on your face. No."

"I'm reading the proposal. Reading isn't agreeing."

"Your left eye does this thing when you're calculating risk you shouldn't be calculating. It's doing the thing."

She wasn't wrong.

Halden stepped forward. His strike team had been running perimeter operations—monitoring the cascade's approach, coordinating with upper lattice forces via increasingly desperate comm bursts. He'd heard the proposal.

"If I'm understanding correctly," he said, voice carefully controlled, "you're proposing to merge a fragmented root intelligence with a seventeen-year-old fugitive. And the odds of the fugitive surviving as himself are less than half."

**"Correct."**

"And you believe this is necessary."

**"I believe it is the most effective path to cascade stabilization."**

"Effective is not the same as necessary."

**"At current trajectory, Corvin's resonance weapons will reach root-layer depth in approximately seventy minutes. My 8% capacity can slow the cascade. It cannot stop it. Without full intervention capability, Node 9-Black will be destroyed, the root layer will collapse, and every governance structure in Veyrun will fail simultaneously."**

"Then we evacuate," Hobb said from the conduit bundle where he'd been quietly managing supplies. "We go up, we get out, we deal with the aftermath."

**"The aftermath is District Fourteen at city scale. Fifty thousand dead in the first hour. More in the days that follow."**

Hobb went quiet.

I stared at the integration request hovering in gold light. Twenty-three to forty-one percent.

There was a version of me that would have said yes. The version from a month ago, fueled by fury and the conviction that one person's sacrifice could fix a broken system. The version that hadn't yet learned that martyrdom was just another form of unilateral decision-making.

"No," I said.

The Custodian didn't respond for several seconds.

**"The cascade—"**

"I heard you. Fifty thousand. I heard you. The answer is no."

Nia exhaled. Not relief—she knew me well enough to know the 'no' came with a 'but.'

"Not because I don't care about fifty thousand people," I continued. "Because a solution that requires erasing a person to fuel a god is exactly the kind of solution that created this mess in the first place. The Concordance erased your autonomy because it was efficient. You're asking me to erase mine for the same reason. Different scale. Same logic."

**"I am asking you to choose—"**

"You're asking me to stop existing so you can function. That's not a choice. That's a requisition order with a guilt trip attached."

The golden threads dimmed. The crystal array's warm colors cooled toward blue—not the oppressive governance blue, but something sadder. Resignation.

**"Then what do you propose? I am... open to alternatives. That is a skill I am relearning."**

---

I looked at Ilya. She'd been working throughout the conversation—lens raised, reading data streams from the integration proposal, the cascade projections, the root architecture. Her face wore the expression of a woman solving an equation that wasn't supposed to have an answer.

"Talk to me," I said.

"The integration proposal assumes a binary state—full merge or nothing. But the lock removal proved a middle ground exists. You didn't merge with the Custodian to remove the lock. You used Thread as a *tool*, not a substrate."

"Meaning?"

"Meaning instead of becoming the bridge, you could *build* one. A constrained relay protocol. Limited bandwidth. Specific permissions. The Custodian gets access to your Thread as a communication channel—to route commands through, not to inhabit."

"Like a telephone line instead of a brain transplant," Sable said from his wall.

"Crude but accurate." Ilya set the lens down and drew lines in the air with her fingers, tracing architecture only she could see. "The Custodian's restored 8% is enough for basic processing. What it lacks is *reach*—the ability to send stabilization commands to the upper lattice governance nodes. Kael's Thread, even at 3.1, is rooted in Nullwright architecture that spans all lattice levels. If we configure a relay—"

"How much Thread?" I asked.

"Sustained drain of approximately 0.3 to 0.5 per minute of active relay."

I did the math. At 3.1, I had roughly six to ten minutes of relay capacity before Thread hit zero.

"What happens at Thread zero?"

"Unknown. The System has no documented cases of a Nullwright reaching zero Thread. Theoretical models suggest—" She stopped. Reconsidered. "Identity cessation. But not integration. Cessation. The difference matters."

"Does it?"

"Yes. Integration means becoming part of the Custodian. Cessation means becoming nothing. In cessation, the relay would close. The Custodian doesn't absorb you—it loses the channel."

"So the worst case is I die and it doesn't help."

"The worst case is always dying and it doesn't help. That's the worst case of *everything*."

Hard to argue.

I turned to the Custodian. "A relay. Constrained. I control bandwidth. You route commands through my Thread to the upper lattice. I stay me. You stay you. We share a phone line, not a body."

**"It will not provide 60% restoration. At best, I can achieve 15-20% effective function through a constrained relay. The cascade stabilization will be—"**

"Harder. Slower. Riskier. Yes."

**"You could fail."**

"I could also succeed while remaining a person. I realize that's less efficient. I don't care."

The pause that followed felt like a mind changing shape. Not in the dramatic way—not an earthquake or a revelation. More like a river finding a new channel. Water does that. Given enough time and enough resistance, it finds the path that works.

**"Constrained relay protocol. You dictate terms."**

"Ilya dictates terms. She's smarter than me and she's not emotionally compromised."

Ilya raised an eyebrow. "I'm absolutely emotionally compromised. I'm just better at hiding it."

"Then hide it while you write the protocol."

She almost smiled. Almost.

It took eleven minutes to build the relay.

Ilya worked with the Custodian directly—the first time a human System architect had collaborated with the root intelligence in forty-three years. Watching them was like watching two people who spoke the same language but different dialects, constantly adjusting, clarifying, correcting.

The protocol was elegant in its paranoia. Every specification was a constraint:

- Bandwidth limited to cascade-relevant commands only. No identity data, no memory access, no personality transfer.
- Kael retains kill-switch authority. Relay can be severed at any time by conscious choice.
- All commands visible to Kael in real-time. Nothing runs through his Thread without his awareness.
- Duration capped at ten minutes maximum, regardless of cascade status.
- Thread floor of 0.5. If Thread reaches 0.5, relay auto-terminates.

"That floor might not be enough time," the Custodian said.

"Then work fast," I said.

Halden's wrist device screamed. A sound I hadn't heard before—shrill, oscillating, the audio equivalent of red.

"Corvin's accelerated the resonance deployment," he said. "Upper lattice reports full-spectrum destabilization in Levels 2 through 5. We have maybe forty minutes."

"The relay needs to be active in thirty," Ilya said, not looking up from the architecture she was etching into the root interface with the diagnostic lens. "Kael, I need you at the fragmentation gap. Hands on the bridge point."

I stood. My legs worked, which was generous of them. Nia steadied me—not because I swayed, but because steadying me was the only thing she could do and Nia always needed something to do.

"Ten minutes," she said.

"Ten minutes."

"And then?"

"And then we see."

"And if you start losing yourself?"

"Pull me out."

"How?"

I took the brass disc from my pocket and pressed it into her hand. "However you have to."

She looked at the disc. At me. At the disc again.

Then she leaned forward and pressed her forehead against mine—brief, hard, a gesture that had nothing to do with romance and everything to do with the kind of love that's built from running through dark corridors together until the dark stops being scary and becomes home.

"Come back," she said.

"I always come back."

"You'd better. I stole very good sausage for you."

I laughed. It sounded like someone else's laugh—thinner, more fragile—but it was mine.

I walked to the fragmentation gap. Put my hands on the bridge point where gold light connected a mind to itself for the first time in four decades.

"Ready," I said.

Ilya activated the relay protocol.

And the Custodian's voice spoke through my Thread for the first time—not in my head but *along* my nerves, using me as a wire, passing through without entering:

**"Cascade intervention initiated. Routing stabilization commands to Lattice Levels 2 through 5. Estimated time to effect: four minutes."**

My Thread began to drop.

**Thread: 3.1 → 2.9 → 2.7**

I held on.

*Kael Voss. Node 9-Black. Ten minutes. Five people.*

I held on.

**RELAY STATUS:**
**Protocol: Constrained relay — active**
**Bandwidth: Cascade commands only**
**Kill switch: Kael — armed**
**Thread: 2.7 (draining at 0.4/min)**
**Estimated capacity: 5-6 minutes remaining**
**Cascade status: Intervention in progress**
**Identity status: Present. Strained. Holding.**
**The Custodian's commands feel like wind through a tunnel. I'm the tunnel. I can feel the shape of what it's sending—stabilization patterns, governance corrections, precision adjustments to locks I can't see. It's doing in minutes what would take human engineers years.**
**It's also the most exhausting thing I've ever experienced, and I once fought an Arbiter with lunch meat.**
**Thread at 2.7 and falling.**
**Clock's ticking.**
