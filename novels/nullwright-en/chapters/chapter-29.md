# Chapter 29 — Zero-Permission War

Four minutes into the relay, the world broke open above us.

Not metaphorically. The ceiling of Node 9-Black—which wasn't really a ceiling so much as the compressed bottom of nine lattice levels stacked like geological strata—*cracked*. A seam of white light split the darkness overhead, and through it poured sound: alarms, screaming metal, the harmonic shriek of governance locks shattering in cascade.

Halden's wrist device died. Not powered down—burned out. The screen went black, then cracked, then smoked. He ripped it off and threw it aside.

"What was that?" he demanded.

Ilya had the diagnostic lens pointed upward. The color drained from her face.

"Corvin's triggered the failsafe," she said.

"Which failsafe?"

"All of them."

---

The text appeared in the air. Not the Custodian's gold. Not the System's blue.

Red.

**CONCORDANCE EMERGENCY PROTOCOL: ABSOLUTE VARIANCE DENIAL**
**Authorization: Archivist-Magister Sel Corvin (Emergency Powers, Self-Granted)**
**Directive: Mass erasure of all unregistered variance signatures within Veyrun metropolitan district**
**Scope: Total**
**Estimated affected entities: 14,000+**
**Status: EXECUTING**

Fourteen thousand.

Every unregistered class holder. Every anomaly. Every person who'd awakened outside guild sponsorship, who carried variance the System hadn't approved, who existed in the gap between legal and real.

The Patchless. The freehold settlers. The Ragline couriers. The quiet rebels who'd hidden their awakenings to avoid guild contracts. The children whose classes hadn't been filed yet because their parents couldn't afford the fee.

Fourteen thousand people who were about to be erased from reality like typos.

"He can't do that," Hobb said. His voice was very quiet. The quiet of a man who knew the answer but needed to say the question. "That authority doesn't exist."

"He created it," Halden said. His face was ash. "Emergency self-authorization. It's technically possible under Chapter 19 of the Concordance Emergency Statutes—any Magister-rank official can invoke unilateral authority during an active existential threat."

"The existential threat being the cascade *he started*?" Nia's voice was a blade.

"Yes." Halden looked like a man watching his own house burn. "He created the crisis to justify the response. The mass erasure isn't a side effect—it's the goal. Every unregistered variance signature he eliminates reduces root-layer complexity. If he kills enough anomalies, the root layer simplifies enough that his resonance weapons can reach the Custodian directly."

"He's murdering fourteen thousand people to make it easier to murder one more," I said.

"He's murdering fourteen thousand people because he believes the System should have zero uncontrolled variables. He always believed that. He just never had the authority to act on it."

Until now.

---

The relay was still running. Thread at 2.3. The Custodian's cascade stabilization commands were flowing through me, but I could feel them stuttering—the failsafe was interfering, creating new instabilities faster than the Custodian could correct old ones.

**"The erasure protocol is propagating through the governance layer,"** the Custodian said through my nerves. **"I can see the command path. It routes through six upper-lattice relay stations before reaching district-level enforcement nodes. Each station amplifies and distributes the signal."**

"Can you block it?"

**"Not through the relay. The bandwidth is insufficient for simultaneous cascade stabilization and erasure countermeasures. To do both, I would need—"**

"Don't finish that sentence."

**"—full integration. Yes."**

"I said don't finish it. What can we do with what we have?"

**"The command path is physical infrastructure. If even one relay station in the chain is disrupted—physically disabled, not digitally countered—the erasure signal fragments. Loses coherence. Buys time."**

"How much time?"

**"Depends on the station. The nearest one is approximately 400 meters above us, at the junction of Lattice Levels 4 and 5. It is the bottleneck—the single-point relay that connects Corvin's upper-level authorization to the lower-district enforcement grid."**

"And if we take it out?"

**"The erasure protocol stalls. Corvin would need to reroute through secondary pathways—slower, more complex. Hours instead of minutes. Enough time for the cascade stabilization to complete and for human intervention at the political level."**

Four hundred meters straight up through lattice infrastructure that was actively destabilizing.

I looked at the team.

Halden was already calculating. "My soldiers can reach Level 4 in approximately twenty minutes. The route is compromised but passable with Arbiter-class gear."

"Twenty minutes," Ilya said. "The erasure protocol will finish executing in twelve."

Silence.

"I can do it in eight," Nia said.

---

Everyone turned to her.

She was standing with the casual poise of a woman who'd just offered to pick up groceries, not sprint 400 meters through collapsing metaphysical infrastructure to disable a relay station that a government official was using to commit mass murder.

"No," I said.

"The vertical shafts between levels have courier maintenance ladders. I know them. I've run them. Levels 4 and 5 junction—that's near the old Ragline express route through the floodgate conduit. I can navigate it in the dark."

"The lattice is destabilizing. Gravity is suggestions. Causality is drunk."

"Then it's a Tuesday."

"Nia—"

"Kael." She stepped close. The brass disc glinted between her fingers. "You are literally the only person who can run the relay. You cannot leave this chamber. Ilya has to monitor the relay protocol. Hobb can't move fast enough. Sable—"

"Could go," Sable said from his wall. He looked pale but steady.

"Could go and would die," Nia said without cruelty. "You're brilliant in corridors you've mapped. These corridors are rewriting themselves. I'm faster, I'm trained for unstable terrain, and I don't have a class that needs stable reality to function."

She wasn't wrong. Hating that she wasn't wrong was a luxury I couldn't afford.

"Take Halden's soldiers," I said.

"They'll slow me down."

"Take *some* of them. You'll need someone to hold the relay station while you disable it."

Halden nodded. "Sergeant Venn and two strike operatives. They know lattice combat." He turned to his soldiers and barked orders in the clipped syntax of a man who'd accepted that today's alliances made yesterday's impossible.

Nia took the brass disc and pressed it into my hand. "You need this more than I do."

"Nia—"

"I know who I am without a magic coin, Kael. Do you?"

Harsh. Fair. Necessary.

I closed my fingers around the disc. "Eight minutes."

"Seven if the ladders hold."

She turned. Drew both knives. The blades caught root-light and turned gold.

"Nia."

She looked back.

I didn't say *be careful*. Careful was an insult to what she was about to do. I didn't say *come back*. She'd already made me promise that and turnabout was just pressure she didn't need.

"You're the best person I know," I said.

She blinked. Once. Something moved behind her eyes—fast, bright, immediately controlled.

"That's very sad for you," she said.

And she was gone. Up through the breach Halden's team had blown in the chamber wall, into the dark lattice above, moving with the fluid certainty of a woman who'd been running through dangerous places since before she could name the danger.

Three soldiers followed.

The breach sealed behind them—the lattice architecture shifting, closing, alive in the worst way.

I was alone at the root interface. Thread at 2.1. Relay active. Custodian routing commands.

All I could do was stand still and hold the line and trust that the fastest person I'd ever known was fast enough.

---

The next six minutes were the longest of my life.

I know that's a cliché. I don't care. Clichés become clichés because they're true, and the truth was that each minute stretched like taffy made of dread. The relay drained Thread in steady increments—2.1, 1.9, 1.7—and with each drop, reality got thinner. The chamber wavered. The golden threads blurred. My vision developed edges that shouldn't exist, corners in curved space, right angles in organic architecture.

The Custodian worked in silence. I felt its commands passing through me—stabilization patterns routing to Levels 2 through 5, each one a precise correction to a specific governance node, each one buying time against the cascade that Corvin had unleashed. It was like being a telegraph wire during a battle: messages flowing through me that I could sense but not read, urgent and vital and not mine.

Ilya monitored from three feet away, lens tracking my Thread signature with the focus of a surgeon watching a heartbeat.

"Thread 1.7," she reported. "Relay holding. Cascade intervention at 40% completion."

"How long for full completion?"

"At current rate... eleven more minutes."

I had maybe four minutes of Thread left.

"Then we won't finish," I said.

"No." She didn't soften it. I appreciated that. "The relay will auto-terminate at 0.5. At that point, the Custodian retains whatever cascade corrections it's completed. The remainder—"

"Stays broken."

"Stays in progress. Slower, harder, but not impossible. If we can buy enough time—if Nia disrupts the erasure relay—the Custodian can complete stabilization through its own restored capacity over the following hours."

If Nia disrupts the relay. If.

I stared at the ceiling. At the white crack where the failsafe's shockwave had split the chamber's sky. Somewhere up there, in corridors that bent like fever dreams, Nia was running with knives and three soldiers she'd met twenty minutes ago, racing a countdown that would kill fourteen thousand strangers.

I couldn't help her.

I couldn't even watch.

All I could do was bleed Thread into a telephone line and hope.

---

Minute seven.

Thread: 1.2.

The relay stuttered.

Not a smooth drain—a *spike*. Thread dropped from 1.2 to 0.9 in a single heartbeat, and pain lanced through my skull like a railroad spike made of light. I gasped. Staggered. Hobb caught me by the arm—steady, strong, the grip of a man who'd carried flour sacks heavier than my body.

"Something's wrong with the relay," Ilya said, lens flaring red. "External interference. The erasure protocol is—it's targeting the relay directly. Corvin found us."

"How?"

"The relay is a detectable signal. We knew that. He's routing erasure energy along the relay path—using Kael's own Thread as a targeting vector for—"

The second spike hit.

This one I felt in my *identity*.

Not pain. Worse. Absence. For one flickering instant I didn't know who I was. Not amnesia—*erasure*. The System briefly classified me as an unregistered variance signature, and the erasure protocol reached down the relay and tried to delete me from reality.

The brass disc screamed. Not metaphorically—the metal vibrated at a frequency that produced an audible tone, sharp and desperate, a sound like a name being shouted across a collapsing building.

I grabbed it with both hands. Pressed it to my sternum. Felt the warmth, the weight, the reality of an object that existed in consensus space and didn't care what the System thought I was.

*Kael Voss. Node 9-Black. I am Kael Voss.*

The erasure attempt failed. The protocol slid off me like water off hot metal—repelled not by power but by the sheer stubborn *thereness* of a person who refused to be a variable.

Thread: 0.8.

"Relay at critical," Ilya said. "Two minutes to auto-termination."

"Nia—"

"No word."

---

Minute eight.

Thread: 0.6.

Hobb was holding me upright. I couldn't feel my legs. My vision was a tunnel—Node 9-Black reduced to a narrow cone of gold light with darkness eating the edges. The relay was a river of fire through my nervous system, each stabilization command a burning wire that I channeled without comprehension.

The Custodian's voice, distant now, filtered through the relay's degrading bandwidth:

**"Cascade intervention at 67%. Erasure protocol still active. The relay station—"**

A sound from above.

Not an alarm. Not a collapse.

An explosion.

The entire chamber shuddered. The white crack in the ceiling flared, then darkened, then flared again in a different pattern—not destruction but *disruption*. The rhythmic pulse of the erasure protocol, which I'd been feeling as a background pressure against my skull, stuttered.

Skipped.

Stopped.

"She did it," Sable breathed from his wall. "She actually—"

The erasure protocol's red text in the air flickered, fragmented, broke apart like a sentence losing its words:

**CONCORDANCE EMERGENCY PROTOCOL: ABSOLUTE VARI—**
**Auth—ation: Ar—vist-Magi—**
**Dir—tive: Mass eras—**
**SIGNAL LOST**
**RELAY STATION 4-5 JUNCTION: OFFLINE**

For one perfect moment, everything was quiet.

Then Ilya's lens screamed.

"Hostile contacts," she said. "Multiple. Incoming through the breach corridor. Arbiter-class drones—Corvin's personal security complement. He's sent them to retake the relay station."

"Nia's up there," I said.

"I know."

"She's up there with three soldiers and the drones are—"

"I *know*, Kael."

Thread: 0.5.

The relay auto-terminated.

The fire in my nerves died. The Custodian's commands stopped flowing. I collapsed—properly collapsed, legs gone, vision gone, the world reduced to the feel of cold glass against my cheek and Hobb's hands on my shoulders and the brass disc burning against my chest like a small sun.

**Thread: 0.5**
**Relay: TERMINATED**
**Status: Alive. Barely. Define "alive" generously.**

"Cascade intervention at 71%," Ilya reported. "The Custodian can complete stabilization independently from here—slowly, but it's past critical threshold. The city will hold."

The city will hold.

I couldn't feel relief because I couldn't feel Nia.

---

Sable moved first.

He peeled off his wall, crossed the chamber in four strides, and crouched beside Halden. "Your soldiers. Are they on the same channel as the drones?"

"Different frequency. My team uses Concordance military encryption. Corvin's drones operate on Collegium research bands."

"Then your people can still communicate?"

Halden tested something at his belt—a backup comm unit, simpler than the burned device. Static. Fragments. Then a voice, broken by interference:

*"—station secured—heavy contact—multiple drone units—Sergeant Venn requesting—"*

"Venn, report," Halden barked.

*"—relay disabled—civilian operative wounded—repeat, civilian operative wounded—holding corridor junction Level 4-C against—"*

The signal died.

Civilian operative.

Nia.

---

I was on my feet before my brain authorized it. My legs shouldn't have worked. Thread at 0.5 meant my body was running on fumes and stubbornness and the particular species of terror that turns exhaustion into irrelevance.

"Kael, you can't—" Ilya started.

"Watch me."

"Your Thread is at functional minimum. If you attempt any exploit—"

"I'm not going to exploit anything. I'm going to walk up four lattice levels and find her."

"You can barely stand."

"Then I'll crawl."

Hobb caught my arm. Not to stop me—to steady me. He pulled my arm over his shoulder and took my weight with the practiced ease of a man who'd hauled cargo through worse places.

"I know the route," he said.

"Hobb—"

"Shut up. Walk."

Halden ordered his remaining soldiers forward. Sable fell in beside us, a knife he'd produced from somewhere held low and professional. Ilya shouldered the diagnostic lens and followed.

We went up.

---

The lattice between Node 9-Black and Level 4 was a nightmare corridor.

The cascade stabilization had arrested the worst of the destabilization, but the infrastructure was damaged—twisted conduits, shattered veinlines leaking light like arterial wounds, gravity shifts that turned floors into walls without warning. Hobb navigated by instinct and memory, finding solid ground where none should exist, routing us through maintenance shafts and service corridors that had survived the upheaval by being too small and too forgotten to matter.

Twice I blanked. Brief ones—seconds, not minutes—but each time I came back with fewer details. The name of the street I'd never remember again. The sound of a voice I used to know. Pieces of myself falling away like roof tiles in a storm.

The brass disc kept me. Its heat. Its weight. Its insistence that I was real.

Three levels up. Two. One.

We heard the fighting before we saw it.

---

Corridor junction Level 4-C was a war zone.

The drones—Corvin's personal security, sleek and angular, built for precision violence in confined spaces—had Venn's team pinned at the junction's chokepoint. Three soldiers, armored and bleeding, held a barricade of collapsed conduit and shattered grating against six drones that moved with the alien grace of things designed to kill in tight corridors.

Behind the barricade, pressed against the wall, was Nia.

She was down.

Not standing. Not fighting. *Down*. Sitting with her back to twisted metal, one hand pressed against her left side where her courier leathers were dark and wet. Her face was the color of old paper. Her eyes were open and focused and furious, which meant she was alive, which meant I could breathe.

But the wet darkness under her hand was spreading.

Too much.

Too fast.

One of the drones had gotten through. I could see the score mark—a precise, clean cut that had bypassed the leather at the seam where mobility mattered more than armor. The kind of wound a machine designed for efficiency would inflict. Maximum damage, minimum effort.

"Nia!" I shouted.

Her eyes found me. "You look terrible."

"You're *bleeding*."

"Noticed. Mostly I'm—" She coughed. The cough had red in it. "—mostly I'm holding this corridor because these three idiots don't know the layout and the drones are flanking through the—Kael, the vent on the right, they're coming through the—"

A drone burst from the ventilation shaft on the right wall.

Sergeant Venn spun and fired—a pulse of governance-coded energy that caught the drone mid-flight and sent it spiraling into the opposite wall where it shattered into angular fragments. But the distraction opened a gap in the barricade, and two more drones surged through the main approach.

Halden stepped past me.

He moved differently than I'd ever seen him move. Not the controlled precision of an Arbiter-Captain performing arrest protocols. Something older, rawer—a soldier remembering that before he was a bureaucrat of reality enforcement, he was a man who knew how to fight in ugly places.

His command spear—shortened to a close-quarters configuration—swept the first drone out of the air with a blow that used the drone's own momentum against it. The second he caught with his damaged arm, absorbing the impact with a grunt that sounded like it cost him something structural, and drove it into the floor where his boot finished the job.

Two more drones retreated. Regrouped. Advanced.

Sable appeared behind them.

I didn't see how. One moment the corridor behind the drones was empty; the next, Sable was there with a knife in each hand and a Signal Weaver's gift for being where attention wasn't. He didn't fight the drones—he *unmade* them. Two precise cuts to power coupling junctions that a smuggler's eye had identified while everyone else focused on blades and armor. The drones dropped like puppets whose strings had been solved.

Silence.

Smoking silence, full of ozone and the sound of people breathing too hard.

I was at Nia's side before the last drone hit the floor.

---

Up close, it was worse.

The wound ran from below her ribs to her hip—not deep enough to be immediately fatal but deep enough to be a clock. She was losing blood in the steady, purposeful way that bodies lose blood when something important has been opened.

"Ilya," I said. My voice came from somewhere calm I didn't feel.

She was already there, lens discarded, hands working. She pressed a field compress against the wound with one hand and reached into Hobb's pack with the other—the supply pack he'd insisted on carrying, the one I'd called unnecessary twelve hours ago.

"Pressure," Ilya said. "Maintain pressure. Don't let her move."

"I can hear you," Nia said. Her voice was thinner now. The fury was still there but the volume was wrong—turned down, like someone adjusting a dial toward silence. "Stop talking about me like I'm furniture."

"Then stop trying to rearrange yourself," Ilya said. "The wound is clean. No organ damage—the angle was lateral, across muscle and tissue. But you've lost significant blood volume and the lattice environment is interfering with natural clotting."

"Meaning?"

"Meaning hold still and let the compress work and for once in your life stop being the most stubborn person in the room."

"Can't. Kael's here."

I pressed my hand over Ilya's on the compress. Nia's blood was warm against my fingers. Warm and real and wrong—blood on the outside is always wrong, and this was the most wrong thing I'd ever touched.

"You disabled the relay," I said.

"Of course I disabled the relay." She managed half a smile. It cost her. "Fourteen thousand people, Kael. I didn't even have to think about it."

"You should've thought about ducking."

"I did duck. The drone was faster." She closed her eyes. Opened them immediately—too fast, compensating for the pull of unconsciousness. "Did the cascade stop? Did we—"

"The cascade is stabilizing. The erasure protocol is down. You did it."

"We did it."

"You ran 400 meters through collapsing reality and physically destroyed a relay station with knives and three strangers. That's a 'you' achievement."

"I'll accept... partial credit." Her voice faded at the edges. The dial turning down further. "Kael. My legs are cold."

Terror.

Not the adrenaline fear of combat. Not the intellectual dread of the cascade. Terror—the animal, wordless kind that lives in the base of the brain where reason doesn't reach. The kind that comes when someone you love says something that means their body is failing and all your power, all your Thread, all your stolen-god relay protocols and lattice-breaking exploits and reality-hacking class abilities amount to exactly nothing because the person bleeding under your hands needs a medic, not a Nullwright.

"Ilya—"

"I know. Blood volume." Her hands moved faster. Second compress layered over the first. Something from Hobb's pack—a vial of clear liquid—uncorked and poured along the wound's edge. Nia hissed. "Clotting accelerant. Old Ragline field medicine. It'll hold if she stays still."

"If?"

"When. She stays still. Nia, look at me."

Nia's eyes drifted to Ilya. The fury was fading. Something more frightened lived underneath—not fear of dying, but fear of not finishing. Of stopping mid-stride.

"You stay still," Ilya said with the voice she used for absolute facts. "You've done your part. Now your body does its part. Let it."

"Bossy."

"Always."

I held her hand. The one not pressed against her side. Her fingers were cold and her grip was weak and the brass disc was between our palms and it was warm enough for both of us.

"Seven minutes," she murmured.

"What?"

"The run. Took seven minutes. Ladders held."

I laughed. Or sobbed. The sound that came out didn't bother distinguishing.

Hobb knelt beside us and draped his coat over Nia's legs. "Cold means circulation's compensating," he said. "Means the body's smart enough to prioritize core. She's tough, boy."

"I know."

"She'll make it."

"I know."

He looked at me with the expression he wore when he was choosing not to lie but also choosing not to share the full truth. "Then hold on. We'll get her up."

Halden stood over us, spear in hand, watching the corridor for more drones. His face held something I didn't expect—not pity, not tactical calculation, but recognition. The look of a man who had watched soldiers bleed for causes they believed in and understood that this corridor, this moment, this girl with knives and a seven-minute miracle, was the same war he'd been fighting from the other side.

"Medics," he said into his backup comm. "Level 4-C junction. Priority extraction. One critical civilian."

Static. Then: *"Acknowledged. En route. Twelve minutes."*

Twelve minutes.

I held Nia's hand and watched the compress darken and counted seconds because counting was a way of staying present and staying present was the whole game now.

Nia's eyes closed.

Opened.

Closed.

Her grip loosened.

"Stay," I said. "Nia, stay."

She opened her eyes. Focused on me with an effort I could measure.

"Still here," she whispered. "Still here, you idiot. Stop looking at me like that."

"Like what?"

"Like I'm furniture."

I held on. The brass disc pulsed between our palms. The corridor smelled like ozone and blood and the metallic sweetness of a lattice remembering how to hold itself together.

Somewhere above us, the cascade slowed. The erasure protocol stayed dead. Fourteen thousand people continued to exist because a girl with knives and courier boots had run faster than bureaucratic murder.

Somewhere below us, a fragmented god used its stolen eight percent to stitch reality back together, one governance node at a time.

And in between—in the broken corridor, in the bleeding silence, in the space where a war had no permissions and no rules and no victors—five people held the line.

Thread at 0.5.

Memory full of holes.

Heart intact.

*End of Chapter 29*
