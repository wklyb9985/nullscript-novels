# Chapter 13 — Fault Market

There's a particular kind of darkness you only find underground—the type that doesn't just block light but seems to have opinions about it. Like the dark has been here so long it considers itself a tenant, and light is the rude guest who never knocks.

I was standing in that darkness at the bottom of a converted cistern three levels below the Freehold's canal district, waiting for a black market to open.

"This feels illegal," I whispered to Nia.

"It is illegal."

"I meant more illegal than our usual illegal."

"There are levels?"

"I like to maintain a personal hierarchy. It helps me sleep."

"Does it work?"

"No."

The cistern was enormous—a barrel-vaulted space that must have been part of the original drainage system before the Freeholds were the Freeholds. Now it served as the Fault Market, which Sable had described as "the place where things that shouldn't exist go to be sold to people who shouldn't have them."

He'd also described it as "the most dangerous room in the marsh, and I include rooms that are actively on fire."

We'd come because Ilya said I needed tools.

Specifically, she said my Fault-Sight was developing faster than my ability to interpret what it showed me. I was seeing more faults—deeper ones, subtler ones, the relational patterns I'd discovered—but the information came in raw, unfiltered, like drinking from a hose. I needed something to focus it. To give structure to the flood.

In the old days, according to the scraps of Nullwright records Ilya had pieced together, practitioners used diagnostic instruments—artifacts from the maintenance layer that were never meant for human hands. Lenses, calipers, tuning forks. Tools that translated System data into formats human senses could process.

Such tools were, naturally, extraordinarily illegal.

And the Fault Market was where illegal went shopping.

---

The market opened at midnight, because of course it did.

Someone struck a resonance bell—a deep tone that I felt in my sternum more than heard—and lanterns flickered to life along the cistern walls. Not fire. Something colder and bluer that cast everything in the kind of light that made faces look like they were already ghosts.

The vendors were arranged in a rough spiral around the cistern floor, each in a carved niche that might have once been a water channel. Their stalls ranged from elaborate—velvet-draped tables with itemized crystal displays—to desperate: a blanket on the ground with three objects and a hand-written sign reading **DON'T ASK WHERE I GOT THEM**.

I appreciated the honesty.

"Stay close," Sable said. He'd come as our guide and broker, because the Fault Market operated on reputation, and his was apparently sufficient to keep us from being stabbed on entry. "Don't touch anything without asking. Don't make eye contact with anyone in masks. Don't use Thread unless you want every vendor in here to know what you are."

"What about breathing?"

"Keep it to a minimum."

We moved through the spiral. Nia flanked me on the right, her hand resting on her belt with the casual readiness that meant she'd catalogued every exit and every person between us and those exits within the first thirty seconds of entry.

The merchandise was extraordinary.

A woman with ritual scarring on her forearms sold fragments of dead wards—crystallized remnants of security systems that had been peeled off restricted areas. "Good for study," she said when she caught me looking. "Better for reverse engineering. Best for scaring people who know what they are."

A man in a sealed helmet offered vials of what he called "Lattice Rain"—condensed processing overflow from maintenance layer nodes. "One drop and your awareness expands for six hours," he promised. "Three drops and you can see through walls. More than five—" He shrugged. "Nobody's reported back."

"That's not reassuring."

"It's not meant to be. This isn't a reassurance market."

In a deeper niche, behind curtains that smelled like dust and old copper, an elderly man displayed instruments.

I stopped.

Actual diagnostic tools. Maintenance layer artifacts, worn and scarred by use, humming with the quiet resonance of things that weren't supposed to exist outside controlled facilities. Calipers with measurement scales I didn't recognize. Tuning forks that vibrated at frequencies I could feel in my teeth. And—

A lens.

Mounted in a brass frame scarred by age and rough handling, the glass itself was the cloudy grey-green of old ice. It was cracked—a single fracture line running diagonally from corner to corner, splitting the lens into two uneven halves. The crack pulsed faintly with a light that was either blue or existed in a color I didn't have a name for.

When I looked at it with Fault-Sight, the room disappeared.

Not literally. But the lens was so dense with fault-line data that everything around it faded to noise. The crack was a wound in the instrument's fundamental structure—not physical, not just glass breaking, but a rupture in the lens's relationship to the System it was designed to read. The two halves were trying to show different layers of reality simultaneously, fighting each other across the fracture.

It was broken. Badly.

It was also the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen, and I include the sunset from Nia's bell tower and the time I found an entire wheel of cheese behind Hobb's shop that he'd forgotten about.

"That one," I said.

The vendor—thin, old, with fingers stained by substances I didn't want to identify—raised an eyebrow. "The diagnostic lens? It's cracked."

"I can see that."

"When I say 'cracked,' I don't mean the glass is damaged. I mean the instrument's calibration is fractured. It shows true fault-line data through the upper half and something... else through the lower half. I haven't been able to determine what the lower half displays."

"Something else like what?"

"Like deeper. Farther. More honest than the System wants to be." He leaned forward. "I acquired it from a Patchless wanderer who said it came out of a sealed maintenance vault. She used it for three months. By the end, she could see faults at double the range and half the effort."

"What happened after three months?"

"She went blind in one eye. The left one." He tapped his own left eye. "The lens shows you more than your nerves can handle. The crack makes it worse—unfiltered data, no safety margins. It's a broken magnifying glass pointed at things that were designed to be invisible."

"How much?"

"More than you have."

Sable stepped in. "She's right, Kael. That's a high-tier artifact, even broken. The price would—"

"How much?" I repeated, to the vendor.

He named a figure in favor tokens that was roughly equivalent to six months of Reva's open-favor debt, compressed into a single transaction.

"I'll trade," I said. "Not tokens."

"What do you have?"

I thought about what I had. No money. No tokens. No artifacts of my own. Just skills that drew heat, knowledge that attracted danger, and a class that made institutions want to kill me.

"Information," I said. "The Quiet Audit data. I can give you an authenticated copy of—"

"Already circulating," the vendor said. "Half the marsh has seen it. Value's dropping by the hour."

Damn. The broadcast had worked too well. Information lost value the moment it stopped being scarce.

"Then a service," I said. "I'm a Nullwright. I can read faults in things you can't see. I can tell you which of your other instruments are actually functional and which are dead weight. Free diagnostic."

He studied me. Not my face—something deeper. Vendors in places like this developed their own kind of sight.

"A Nullwright," he said. "That's not a class I've heard in a long time."

"There's a reason for that."

"Several reasons, most of them violent." He glanced at his display—twelve instruments, assorted tools, various artifacts. "You can tell me which ones work?"

"I can tell you which ones *really* work, and how well, and how long they have before they fail."

He considered. Then he pulled the lens from its display and set it on the counter between us.

"Diagnose my inventory. Every piece. Honest assessment. If you're accurate on the ones I've already tested, you can have the lens."

---

It took twenty minutes.

Twenty minutes of Fault-Sight at high intensity, parsing each instrument's internal structure, finding the places where function met failure, where design met decay. My head throbbed by the fifth piece. My left eye twitched by the eighth. By the twelfth, I had a nosebleed that I caught on my sleeve while trying to look professional.

Three of his instruments were dead—no remaining function, just pretty shells. Four were degraded but operational. Two were fully functional and worth more than he was charging. Two were dangerous—unstable in ways that could hurt the user. And one—a small tuning fork I almost overlooked—was humming at a frequency that matched root-layer resonance.

"That fork," I said, pointing with a shaking hand. "You should either lock it in a vault or throw it in the canal. It's attuned to root-layer frequencies. If an Arbiter scans within a block of here, it'll ring like a bell."

The vendor's face went very still. He picked up the fork with cloth-wrapped fingers and placed it in a lead-lined box without a word.

"The three on the left are dead. Middle four are functional but degraded—maybe six months of use left. The two brass pieces are your best stock. And the caliper set—" I pointed to a pair of curved instruments that looked like medical tools designed by a paranoid mathematician. "—has a micro-fracture in the pivot joint. It's measuring accurately now, but one sharp impact will offset the calibration permanently."

He checked my assessments against his own records. I watched his eyes move, comparing.

"You missed nothing," he said. "And you caught two things I hadn't." He pushed the lens across the counter. "Take it."

"Thank you."

"Don't thank me. That lens is going to hurt you. I'm selling you a beautiful piece of pain."

I picked it up. The brass was warm. The crack pulsed.

When I held it to my eye—just for a second, just to see—the world peeled open.

Fault-Sight through the lens was Fault-Sight with the volume turned to eleven and the safety removed. Every crack, every desync, every probability tremor in the cistern lit up like a constellation. I could see the relational gaps between stones, the timing drift in the lantern crystals, the state mismatches in vendor inventory where objects were registered to the wrong owners or logged at the wrong locations.

Through the lower half—the cracked half—I saw something else.

Deeper lines. Thicker. Slower. Moving through the bedrock like veins carrying something old. Not faults, exactly. More like scars. Places where the System had been wounded and healed incorrectly, leaving tissue that remembered being broken.

Root-layer artifacts. Visible. Readable.

The pain arrived approximately one second later.

It started behind my left eye—a hot needle pressing inward—and spread across my temple like cracks in ice. My vision strobed. The cistern doubled, tripled, collapsed back into one image that was too sharp, too detailed, too *much*.

I lowered the lens. Blinked until the world stopped vibrating.

"Beautiful piece of pain," I muttered.

**EQUIPMENT ACQUIRED: Diagnostic Lens (Fractured)**
**Effect: Fault-Sight amplification (+200% range, +150% detail)**
**Side Effect: Neural strain (cumulative). Prolonged use risks sensory damage.**
**Condition: Cracked — lower element displays unfiltered sub-layer data**
**Warning: This equipment is not registered. Possession constitutes a Concordance offense.**

Nia was looking at me with an expression that mixed concern with the specific resignation of someone who'd accepted that her friend would keep acquiring dangerous things and all she could do was make sure he survived them.

"Your nose is bleeding again," she said.

"Occupational hazard."

"Your occupation is going to kill you."

"That's most occupations in this economy."

She handed me a cloth. I pressed it to my face.

And then the lights went out.

---

Not the lanterns—those kept burning. But the market's ambient resonance, the low hum that had been vibrating through the cistern since we'd arrived, cut dead. In its place: silence so abrupt it had texture.

Then three things happened in rapid succession.

First: a resonance ping swept through the space—a diagnostic pulse that made every Thread-sensitive person in the cistern flinch. I felt it like a cold hand running down my spine.

Second: the main entrance exploded inward. Not with fire—with force. A compression wave that blew vendors' displays sideways and sent a cascade of artifacts skittering across the stone floor.

Third: a voice, amplified and precisely neutral, filled the chamber.

"Concordance enforcement. Illegal artifact exchange. Participants submit for processing."

Halden's people.

Not Halden himself—the voice was wrong, too young, too eager. But Concordance Ledger Guard in full tactical configuration poured through the breach: six, eight, twelve of them, armored in resonance-dampening plate, carrying containment arrays that crackled with ward energy.

The market erupted.

Vendors grabbed merchandise and ran. Buyers scattered. Someone threw a dead ward fragment at the lead guard, which accomplished nothing except making the guard flinch and look annoyed.

Sable materialized at my elbow. "South channel. Now."

"We can't leave the vendors—"

"We *can* and *will.* Every second we stay is a second closer to containment. Move."

Nia was already moving, cutting through the panicking crowd with the efficiency of a courier who'd spent her life navigating chaos. I shoved the lens into my coat and followed, Sable guiding us through overturned stalls and fleeing bodies toward a secondary channel I hadn't noticed—a low arch in the cistern's south wall, half-hidden behind collapsed shelving.

We made it ten steps before a containment net hissed past my ear and detonated against the wall, spreading crackling blue filaments across the stone.

Close. Too close.

Another net launched. Nia grabbed my collar and yanked me sideways as it sailed through the space my head had occupied.

"Stop being tall!" she snapped.

"I'll work on it!"

We reached the arch. Sable ducked through first, then Nia, then me.

The channel was narrow—utility infrastructure, old water management, barely wide enough for single-file movement. We ran. Behind us, boots and shouted orders echoed into the passage.

I didn't think. I acted.

Fault-Sight flared—easier now, almost reflexive. The channel was riddled with relational gaps. Old pipes connected to walls through assumed bonds. Electrical conduits strung between anchor points through inferred relationships.

I reached with Thread and questioned three connections simultaneously.

*Does this pipe belong to this wall? Does this conduit anchor to this bracket? Does this ceiling beam rest on this support?*

For one second, the System reconsidered.

The pipe shifted. The conduit sagged. The beam groaned.

Then all three reasserted—but not before a shower of dust, stone fragments, and loosened hardware cascaded into the passage behind us, creating a debris barrier that wasn't a collapse so much as a very aggressive suggestion that the passage was no longer walkable.

**EXPLOIT CHAIN: Relational Displacement (x3)**
**Thread Cost: 3.2**
**Signature: [NO MATCH]**
**Attention: +1 (local detection)**

The boots behind us stumbled, swore, and stopped.

We didn't.

We surfaced three blocks from Blackmoss Hall, gasping and filthy, crawling out of a drainage grate into cold marsh air.

Sable checked his signal crystals. "Pursuit has stalled. They're trying to clear the blockage, but—" He grinned, wild and genuine, the first unguarded expression I'd seen from him. "They don't know what caused it. Their after-action report is going to be hilarious."

"Glad my near-death is entertaining."

"Everything about you is entertaining. It's your most dangerous quality."

Nia brushed debris from her leathers and gave me a once-over—the tactical kind, checking for injuries. "You used Thread in there."

"Relational exploits. Three of them."

"And the lens?"

I touched my coat. The brass frame was warm against my ribs. "Safe."

"Not what I meant. You looked through it in there. How bad?"

My left eye was still twitching. My head felt like someone had reorganized its contents without consulting me. The nosebleed had stopped but the taste of copper lingered at the back of my throat.

"Manageable," I said.

"Liar."

"Practiced liar. There's a difference."

She didn't smile, but she stopped pressing. That was its own form of trust—knowing when to let me be stupid on my own terms.

We made it back to Blackmoss Hall as the first grey light touched the marsh. Hobb was waiting at the door, because Hobb was always waiting at the door, because some people express love through insomnia and aggressive preparedness.

"You're alive," he said.

"Provisionally."

"You're bleeding."

"Occupationally."

He stepped aside to let us in, then locked the door with three separate bolts and a chair wedged under the handle.

I went to my room, set the lens on the small table beside my cot, and sat looking at it. The crack pulsed softly in the pre-dawn light—blue, or something adjacent to blue, something the human eye wasn't built for.

Through the upper half: sharper Fault-Sight. Better range. Clearer reads. A tool that would make me more capable, more precise, more dangerous.

Through the lower half: root-layer scars. Deep architecture. Things the System had buried and healed over and forgotten. Things that weren't supposed to be visible to anyone, ever, and certainly not to a seventeen-year-old with a stolen class and a talent for structural blasphemy.

I'd paid for the lens with knowledge. The vendor had said it would pay me back in pain.

Fair trade, I supposed. That seemed to be how everything worked now. You get something precious. It costs something you can't afford. You pay anyway, because the alternative is standing still while the world closes in.

**Thread: 14 → 15**
**Fault-Sight: Rank 2 (amplified via Diagnostic Lens — effective range x3)**
**Equipment: Diagnostic Lens (Fractured) — equipped**
**Attention: 15 watchers**
**Note: Concordance enforcement encountered at Fault Market. Pursuit evaded. Operational signature remains unclassified.**

Fifteen watchers.

The number kept climbing. But for the first time, I had a tool that let me see them as clearly as they saw me.

Maybe clearer.

The lens pulsed on the table, patient as a promise.

Somewhere beyond the marsh, the Concordance was digesting the Quiet Audit data, four thousand names spreading through the population like dye in water. They couldn't suppress it all. They couldn't un-name the erased. The information was out there, multiplying, being read by people who'd wondered where their neighbors went and were finally learning the answer.

And somewhere closer—in the crack between the lens halves, in the root-layer scars visible only through broken glass—something old had noticed me noticing it.

I could feel it the way you feel someone watching you from across a room. Not hostile. Not friendly. Just... attentive.

I didn't look through the lower half again. Not tonight.

But I knew I would.
