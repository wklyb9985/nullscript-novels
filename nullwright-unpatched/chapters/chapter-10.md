# Chapter 10 — Thread Theory

Ilya started my first real lesson by throwing a rock at my head.

Not a big rock. Maybe the size of a plum. But she threw it from three feet away without warning while I was eating breakfast, and it clipped my ear hard enough to make me spill porridge down my shirt.

"What the—"

"Fault-Sight," she said. "On. Now."

"I was *eating*."

"The Concordance won't wait until you've finished your oats." She held up another rock. "Again."

She threw. I flinched. It hit my shoulder.

"You're not looking," she said.

"I'm looking at the crazy woman throwing rocks at me!"

"You're looking with your eyes. I need you looking with Thread."

Behind her, Nia sat on a crate cleaning a knife, radiating the quiet amusement of someone who'd been told there would be entertainment and was not disappointed.

"Don't help me," I said to her.

"Wasn't planning to."

"Friendship is a myth."

Ilya picked up a third rock. "Thread is not a muscle. You don't flex it. It's closer to—" She paused, searching. "Peripheral vision. You know how you can see movement at the edge of your sight without looking directly at it?"

"Yes."

"Thread works the same way. You don't aim Fault-Sight at something. You let the faults come to you. The cracks in things, the timing mismatches, the places where expected state doesn't match actual state—they're always there. You're just not relaxed enough to notice."

"Relaxation is difficult when rocks are incoming."

"That's the point." She threw.

This time I didn't try to see the rock. I tried to see *wrong*.

For half a heartbeat—less—I felt it. A ripple in the air where something small and heavy moved through space slightly faster than the local drag coefficient expected. A tiny wrongness, like a note played in the wrong key.

I leaned left.

The rock sailed past my ear and cracked against the wall.

Ilya's eyes narrowed. "You saw that."

"I felt it. Sort of. Like a wrinkle."

"A wrinkle in what?"

"In... how things are supposed to be? The rock was too fast for how dense the air is here, or—I don't know, it felt *off*."

She set down her remaining ammunition and pulled a stool across from me. Morning light from the hall's narrow windows caught dust motes that drifted between us like tiny, oblivious spectators.

"That's exactly right," she said. "And that's exactly dangerous."

---

Here's what Ilya taught me on the first day, between rock throws and increasingly existential dread:

Thread isn't magic. It isn't mana, spirit energy, or any of the other words the guild academies use for the fuel that powers class abilities. Thread is *attention*. System attention.

When a person uses Thread, they're not drawing on some internal reserve like a water tank. They're pulling focus from the System itself—redirecting processing priority toward their local space, forcing the maintenance layer to allocate resources to their actions.

"Think of it like this," Ilya said, pacing. She'd taken to pacing when she explained things, as if the ideas couldn't survive stillness. "The System processes billions of interactions every second. Most of them are routine—gravity, friction, temperature, biological functions. It handles those on autopilot. Low priority. Barely any attention."

"Like Hobb counting inventory he's counted a thousand times."

"Exactly. Now imagine you walk into Hobb's shop and set the counter on fire."

"Bold strategy. He'd kill me."

"But he'd *look*. You'd have his full attention. Every resource redirected to the fire. That's what Thread does. When you exploit a fault, you're creating a small fire in the System's attention space. It has to look. It has to process. And while it's processing, the rules in that local area become... flexible."

"Flexible how?"

"Flexible enough for a Nullwright to manipulate."

I chewed on this. Literally—I'd recovered my porridge and was eating with one hand while processing metaphysics with whatever part of my brain handles bad news.

"So when I jammed the containment grid back in District Nine—"

"You pulled enormous System attention to one localized area. The infrastructure failure wasn't a side effect. It was the *cost*. The System redirected so much processing to handle your exploit that everything else in the zone degraded. Lights, water pressure, heating—all deprioritized."

"The six hundred people who lost rations."

"Yes."

My porridge didn't taste great anymore.

"There's a second cost," she said, quieter now. "And this is the one that will kill you if you don't understand it."

"I love morning conversations that start with 'this will kill you.'"

"Thread leaves a signature. Every time you use it, the System records the pattern—how you pulled focus, what fault you exploited, the specific manipulation you performed. It catalogues it. And then it patches against it."

"I know. Exploits stop working."

"That's the obvious part. The less obvious part is that the signature is *yours*. It's attached to your identity. Your Thread use doesn't just teach the System how to fix the fault—it teaches the System how to find *you*."

She let that settle.

"Every exploit you perform is a beacon," she said. "A unique fingerprint that says 'Kael Voss was here, and this is how he thinks.' The Concordance doesn't even need to track you physically. They just need to watch for your signature appearing in the lattice."

I put the porridge down. "So using my abilities makes me stronger but also makes me easier to hunt."

"Worse. It makes the world harder for *everyone* who might try similar things. Your exploits don't just patch for you—they patch for all potential Nullwrights. You're not just burning your own tricks. You're burning possibilities."

"That's—" I stopped. Started again. "That's a terrible design."

"It's a brilliant design. From the Concordance's perspective, every anomaly is a free security audit. You find the holes, they seal them. You train their defenses by attacking them."

A small, cold knot formed in my stomach. Every time I'd felt clever—the eel and the pressure lock, the floodgate wheel, the containment grid—I'd been doing free labor for the people trying to erase me.

Nia's knife-cleaning paused. "Is there a way around it?"

Ilya hesitated. That was new—Ilya didn't usually hesitate. She selected words like a surgeon selecting scalpels.

"There are ways to *reduce* the signature. Never use the same exploit pattern twice. Vary your approach constantly. Introduce noise—random actions that muddy the data. Think of it as speaking a different language every time you open your mouth."

"I barely speak one language well."

"Then learn fast. Because the alternative is becoming perfectly predictable, and perfectly predictable means perfectly containable."

---

We spent the rest of the morning on what Ilya called "pattern vocabulary"—the basic categories of faults I could perceive and exploit.

Timing faults: desynchronization between when an event should occur and when it actually does. These were the most common and the easiest to use. The pressure lock in Lattice Nine. The floodgate wheel. Anything where the System's clock was a fraction off.

State faults: mismatch between what the System thinks is true and what's actually true. A locked door that the maintenance layer has already logged as open. A person the registry lists as present who has already left. Reality disagreeing with the paperwork.

Probability faults: places where random outcomes cluster unnaturally. Too many coin flips landing the same way. Too many structural failures in the same block. The System's randomness engine stuttering. These were rare, subtle, and according to Ilya, the most powerful to exploit.

"Probability faults let you cheat physics," she said. "But they also attract the most attention. An Arbiter can detect a probability exploitation from three districts away."

"Noted. Don't cheat physics where Arbiters can hear."

"Don't cheat physics at all unless you're ready for the consequences."

"Also noted, but with less conviction."

She almost smiled. Almost.

For practice, she had me scan Blackmoss Hall's interior—just perceive, not touch. I sat cross-legged on the common room floor, let my eyes unfocus, and tried to find the peripheral-vision state she'd described.

It came in waves. Most of the building was solid—well-maintained, structurally sound, boringly normal. But at the edges I found hairline cracks of wrongness. A window latch that was slightly out of temporal alignment with its frame—the latch thought it was locked 0.2 seconds before the frame agreed. A floorboard near the kitchen with a state discrepancy: the System recorded its weight tolerance at forty stone, but the actual wood had degraded to maybe thirty.

Tiny things. Meaningless things.

But seeing them changed how the world felt. Like learning a new word and suddenly hearing it everywhere. The building hadn't changed. My perception had.

"I can see seven faults in this room," I said.

"How many could you exploit?"

I considered. Each one was small—too small for anything dramatic. "Maybe two. The window latch timing is off enough that I could pop it open without touching it. And the floorboard—I could convince the System it's already broken, which might cause it to actually break."

"And the cost?"

"Thread burn, proportional to the complexity. Minimal for the latch. Moderate for the floorboard, because I'd be changing a state value."

"And the signature?"

I paused. "Both would register as timing and state manipulation. My style. Catalogued."

"Good. You're learning." She stood. "Now do something useful with that knowledge. Open the window latch."

I focused on the latch. The timing desync pulsed gently—a fault so small it was barely there. I reached with Thread, not physically but with that quality of focused attention, and *nudged* the desync wider. For a quarter-second, the latch existed in a state where it believed it was already open.

The metal clicked. The window swung ajar. Cool marsh air drifted in.

**EXPLOIT REGISTERED**
**Type: Timing Desync (Micro)**
**Thread Cost: 0.3**
**Signature: Logged**
**Attention: No change (sub-threshold)**

"Huh," I said. "That didn't hurt."

"Because it was trivial. The System barely noticed. That's the key—stay below the attention threshold and you can operate indefinitely. Cross it, and you're back on their map."

"So I should only ever do tiny, useless things. Very inspiring."

"You should learn to do big things from many tiny things. Chain micro-exploits. Each one sub-threshold. The cumulative effect significant. The individual signatures too small to profile."

I stared at her. "That's... actually clever."

"I was a System Architect. Clever was the minimum qualification."

Nia hopped off her crate. "The minimum qualification for what? Building the cage or escaping it?"

Ilya's expression didn't change, but something behind her eyes flinched. "Both. That's why I'm qualified to teach either."

The air in the room got heavier. Nia held Ilya's gaze for three seconds—long enough to make a point, short enough to not make it a fight—then shrugged and went to check on Hobb.

I filed this under "things that will become a problem later" and got back to practice.

---

By afternoon, I could open every latch in Blackmoss Hall without triggering an attention spike. Thrilling stuff. Really living the outlaw fantasy. At this rate I'd be terrorizing window fixtures across the entire marsh by month's end.

But Ilya wasn't done.

She took me to the building's basement—a damp stone space that smelled like old water and older secrets. In the center, she'd arranged a set of objects: a rusted lock, a clay cup, a length of rope, and a lantern with a cracked glass.

"Controlled environment," she said. "Each object has at least one exploitable fault. I want you to find them, chain them, and produce a single useful outcome."

"What outcome?"

"That's for you to decide. The point isn't the result—it's the process. A Nullwright doesn't cast spells. A Nullwright reads conditions and constructs opportunities."

I studied the objects with Fault-Sight.

The lock had a state fault—its internal mechanism was registered as intact, but two pins had corroded past function. The System hadn't updated.

The cup had a probability fault—a micro-cluster of unlikely stress patterns that made it simultaneously stable and on the edge of shattering. Schrödinger's pottery.

The rope had a timing fault in its tension—the fibers were degrading faster than the System tracked, meaning it would hold weight the System said it shouldn't, or fail under weight the System said it could bear.

The lantern's crack was just a crack. No exploitable fault. Just broken glass being honestly broken.

"The lantern's clean," I said.

"Correct. Not everything is exploitable. Knowing what you can't use is as important as knowing what you can."

I circled the remaining three objects. Chain them. Produce an outcome. My mind worked the way it always had—the same way I'd planned petty theft routes through market crowds, the same way I'd calculated how many rolls I could lift from Hobb's bread delivery before the count became suspicious.

Start with what you want. Work backward to what you have.

What did I want? Something useful. Something that proved I could do more than pop latches.

I knelt beside the lock. Reached with Thread and told the System what its own records already claimed: the lock was intact. Functional. Ready to receive a key.

The corroded pins realigned with a grinding screech, forcing themselves into positions the physical metal couldn't sustain. For about five seconds, the lock was functional again—not because I'd fixed it, but because I'd convinced reality it wasn't broken.

While the lock held, I grabbed the rope and threaded it through the lock's shackle. The rope's timing fault meant it was stronger than advertised for approximately the next ten seconds before the System caught up.

I pulled.

The rope held. The lock held. Together they created a functioning restraint that should have been impossible—a corroded lock clasping degraded rope, both operating on borrowed time against the System's own outdated records.

The cup I left alone. Probability faults scared me, and I didn't need it.

The whole thing lasted maybe eight seconds before reality reasserted itself. The lock pins crumbled. The rope fibers snapped. Both objects collapsed into their actual states with a sad little clatter.

But for eight seconds, I'd built something from nothing.

**EXPLOIT CHAIN REGISTERED**
**Components: State Override (Lock) + Timing Extension (Rope)**
**Duration: 8.2s**
**Thread Cost: 1.4**
**Cumulative Signature: Low (sub-profile threshold)**
**Note: First successful controlled chain. Classification pending.**

I read the notification twice. *First successful controlled chain.*

"Classification pending," I murmured. "Even the System doesn't know what to call me."

Ilya examined the broken objects. "How do you feel?"

"Tired. Headache starting. Left eye twitches."

"Thread fatigue. It'll pass. The important thing is you stayed below threshold."

"I made a lock work for eight seconds. Halden must be quaking."

"Halden should be. Because eight seconds of impossible is all you need to turn a sealed door into an open one, a broken weapon into a functional one, or an escape route into a viable one." She met my eyes. "Scale is irrelevant. Timing is everything."

I flexed my hands. The bandages were off now—the burns from the marshline crossing had healed to shiny pink patches that ached when I made fists. My Thread channels still felt tender, like overworked muscles. But the fatigue wasn't the blinding agony of the crossing. It was the honest tiredness of practice.

For the first time since the alley wall opened and swallowed me, I felt like I was learning to use what I had instead of just surviving what it did to me.

**Thread: 12 → 13**
**Fault-Sight: Rank 1 (approaching Rank 2 threshold)**
**Attention: 11 watchers (inactive in current territory)**

That evening I found Sable in the common room, hunched over a spread of papers covered in symbols I didn't recognize.

"What's that?"

He covered them with his arm like a schoolboy hiding answers. "Business."

"Your business involves a lot of geometric shapes."

"Signal routing diagrams. I'm mapping Concordance communication relays near the Freehold border." He scooped the papers into a leather folder. "How was school?"

"I learned that every time I use my abilities, I'm writing a love letter to the people trying to kill me."

"Ah. The signature problem."

"You know about it?"

"Everyone in the underground knows about it. Why do you think most anomalies don't last? They find one trick, use it until the Concordance profiles them, and then get scraped out of reality like grease off a pan." He leaned back. "The smart ones change their approach constantly. The smarter ones stop using exploits entirely and find other ways to be useful."

"And the smartest?"

"Dead, mostly. Being smart and being lucky are different skills, and luck doesn't scale."

Cheerful man. I sat across from him. "Ilya says I should chain micro-exploits instead of big dramatic ones. Stay below the attention threshold."

"She's right. She usually is. It's her most irritating quality." He glanced at me sideways. "But there's something she's not telling you, because she's a teacher and teachers parcel out bad news like medicine—one spoonful at a time."

"What's she holding back?"

"Thread doesn't just leave signatures. It leaves *you*. Every time you channel it, you push a piece of your identity into the System's awareness. Not your name, not your face—something deeper. Your decision patterns. Your risk tolerance. The shape of how you think."

"That's what she said. The signature."

"No. The signature is what you *do*. I'm talking about what you *are*. The System doesn't just learn your tricks—it learns *you*. And the more Thread you use, the more legible you become. Not just to the Concordance. To the System itself."

He said it casually, the way he said everything—like dangerous information was just another commodity he traded. But his eyes were steady.

"How do you know this?" I asked.

"I grew up in the Freeholds. We had anomalies passing through all the time. Patchless, Ragliners, broken-class survivors. I watched what happened to them. The ones who used Thread heavily—they changed. Not their abilities. Their *personalities*. They became... legible. Predictable. Like the System was reading them back."

A chill that had nothing to do with the marsh air.

"Is that what happened to the Custodian?" I asked. "Whatever's in the root layer—did it become so legible the System just... absorbed it?"

Sable's expression shuttered. "Don't ask me about root-layer entities. I deal in signals, not theology."

"That wasn't a no."

"It wasn't a yes either. Go to bed, Kael. You look like someone who learned too much in one day, which is exactly the kind of person who does something stupid before sunrise."

He wasn't wrong.

I climbed the stairs to the room I shared with the sound of Hobb's snoring (architectural in volume, geological in duration) and lay on my cot staring at the ceiling.

Thread: 13. Attention: 11. Signature: catalogued.

Every step forward was a step more visible. Every trick learned was a trick taught to the enemy. Every piece of myself I channeled through the System was a piece the System kept.

I closed my eyes and felt the world's faults humming at the edge of perception—tiny wrongnesses in wood and stone and air, a constant quiet static of things being slightly other than they seemed.

It should have been frightening. It was, a little.

But mostly it felt like the first honest conversation I'd ever had with the world. Here are the cracks. Here are the lies. Here is where the mask doesn't quite fit.

My status pane pulsed once, soft as a heartbeat.

**CLASSIFICATION UPDATE**
**Nullwright (Provisional) → Nullwright (Active)**
**Advisory: Signature profile initiated. Recommend operational variance.**

Active.

Not provisional anymore.

Whatever I was becoming, the System had decided it was real.

I pulled the blanket over my head and wished, briefly and uselessly, that I was still just a grocer's apprentice who stole his own lunch.

Then I started planning tomorrow's practice, because wishing is for people with fewer watchers.
