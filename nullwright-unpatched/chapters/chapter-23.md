# Chapter 23 — The Registry Burn

The plan was Sable's, which meant it was either brilliant or a con. Possibly both. Sable operated in that liminal space where genius and grift held hands and dared you to tell them apart.

"The Central Registry Annex," he said, spreading a blueprint across Hobb's counter like a dinner cloth, "holds the original claim contracts for every unsponsored Awakening in Districts Seven through Twelve. Forty-two thousand names. Forty-two thousand people whose class rights are owned by guilds that bought them at auction before the ink was dry."

He tapped the blueprint. "We burn it."

"Burn it," Hobb repeated, in the tone he usually reserved for customers who tried to haggle on salt.

"Metaphorically. Mostly. We erase the binding records from the registry crystals. Without originals, the claim contracts are legally void under Section Fourteen of the Concordance Charter—which, delightfully, the Concordance wrote to protect *its own* record integrity. They never imagined someone would use their own paranoia about document fraud to invalidate their own exploitation."

Ilya leaned over the blueprint. "The annex is a secondary storage facility, not a primary registry. The main records—"

"Are in the Governance Spire, yes, behind nine layers of ward and an Arbiter detail that makes Halden's squad look like crossing guards. Untouchable. But the annex holds the *originals*. The crystals with embedded biometric claim-bindings. Everything in the Spire is a copy. Destroy the originals, and any legal challenge to the copies becomes viable."

"How viable?" Nia asked.

"Enough to tie the courts in knots for years. Enough to create legal ambiguity that prevents enforcement. Enough to make forty-two thousand claim contracts *arguable*."

He grinned. The grin of a man who'd found a seam in the social code and was about to exploit it harder than I ever exploited a fault line.

"And you're sure about the legal mechanics?" Ilya pressed.

"I've been running signals intelligence for three organizations that hate each other. I read Concordance contract law the way some people read adventure novels. Yes, I'm sure."

"Why are you telling us instead of selling it?" I asked.

The grin dimmed by one degree. Not gone—adjusted. "Because selling information got my mother's name on a contract in that annex. District Eight. Claim-bound at fourteen. Died at thirty-one in a guild workhouse." He folded the blueprint corner, precise and unhurried. "Some debts don't settle in coin."

The room recalibrated around that sentence.

---

The annex sat in the commercial district between a tax office and a records hall, disguised as the boring thing it mostly was: a climate-controlled vault for paperwork nobody thought anyone would want to steal.

The security was institutional, not military. Ward locks on the doors. Two Ledger Guard rotating shifts. A permission lattice around the crystal vault that required authorized credentials to access.

Normally, I'd spoof those credentials with Ghost Permission—borrow a nearby authorized signature, slip through, do the work.

Normally, I had Thread to spare and an anchor to fall back on.

Today I had 8.4 Thread, a sixty-percent cognitive anchor made of brass and hope, and a brain that occasionally forgot what month it was.

"I'm not the right tool for this," I said. It cost something to admit.

"You're the only tool we have that can bypass the permission lattice," Ilya replied.

"The patch storm—"

"Doesn't reach inside the annex. The vault has its own isolated ward system, installed decades ago. Concordance never integrated it with the adaptive network because it was too old to interface." She allowed herself a thin smile. "Legacy infrastructure. It's vulnerable precisely because nobody updated it."

"So the one place the patch storm can't touch is the one place we need to break into."

"Irony is not dead. It's merely employed by the universe."

---

We went at night. Of course we went at night. Every heist in history goes at night, because criminals and storytellers share the same instinct for theatrical lighting.

The team was small. Me, Nia, Sable. Ilya on remote signal support through a borrowed Ragline relay. Hobb coordinating civilian evacuation from the surrounding blocks in case everything went loud.

Sable got us through the outer perimeter by being Sable—forged credentials, a stolen shift schedule, and a fifteen-second conversation with a guard that somehow ended with the guard believing he'd been told to take a break by his own supervisor. I still don't know how he does it. Charisma shouldn't be a weapon, but Sable had weaponized his like a knife made of handshakes.

Nia got us through the physical space. Three locked doors, two hallways, one staircase—each mapped and timed from surveillance she'd run over two days of courier routes past the building. She moved like water through stone: finding gaps, fitting through, never touching the edges.

My job was the vault.

The crystal vault was in the basement—a reinforced room behind a permission lattice that glowed faint gold in Fault-Sight. Old school. Static. The kind of security I'd learned to read in my first month as a Nullwright, back when the world's defenses were predictable and my Thread was a resource instead of a countdown.

I pressed my hands to the lattice frame and let Fault-Sight unfold.

The seams were clean. Stable. Unchanged in years. No adaptive rewriting, no shuffling values, no storm. Just a simple, elegant authorization check: present valid credentials or be rejected.

I almost wept with relief.

Ghost Permission activated with a whisper of Thread—spoofing a credential signature from the guard Sable had dismissed upstairs. The lattice shimmered, considered, and parted like curtains.

**Thread expenditure: 0.8**
**Current Thread: 7.6**

Low. But enough.

The vault opened.

---

Forty-two thousand lives sat in crystal.

The registry crystals were arranged in floor-to-ceiling racks—narrow, hexagonal columns of pale blue, each containing encoded claim-bindings. Names, classes, dates, guild claimants. Every crystal was a person who'd been Awakened and immediately converted into property.

I'd known this intellectually. Ilya had explained the system. Hobb had lived under it. Nia had been born into it.

Standing in the room was different.

The crystals hummed. A low, barely audible frequency, like bees behind glass. Each one alive with the data of a human being reduced to contractual notation. I reached out and touched one at random.

**CLAIM RECORD 7-11-4429**
**Subject: Maren Dhol, Age 16**
**Class: Brick-Singer (Provisional)**
**Claimant: Aegis Mercantile, District 7 Subsidiary**
**Status: Active. Subject labor-bonded through age 40.**

Sixteen years old. Labor-bonded for twenty-four years because she'd Awakened a construction class in the wrong district.

I pulled my hand back.

"How do we erase them?" Nia asked. She was staring at the racks with an expression I'd only seen once—when she'd told me about her mother's courier debt.

Sable produced a small device from his coat. It looked like a music box mated with an alchemist's nightmare: brass housing, quartz resonator, three toggle switches labeled in a script I didn't recognize. "Resonant purge unit. Patchless design. Generates a frequency that destabilizes crystal storage matrices. Thirty seconds of exposure per rack should corrupt the data beyond reconstruction."

"Should?" I said.

"Will. Almost certainly will. Ninety-two percent confidence."

"What's the other eight percent?"

"The crystals are very old. Old things are stubborn."

Nia was already moving. "Six racks. We split: Sable takes the north wall, I take the south, Kael—"

"Watches the door and provides a warning if anything comes through the lattice," I said. "I'm not touching Thread again unless I have to."

She paused. Looked at me. Nodded once—not pity, not relief. Acknowledgment. Acceptance of a reality we'd both spent two days learning to swallow.

I took position at the vault door and watched through Fault-Sight while Sable and Nia worked.

The resonant purge was quiet—a soft, rising tone that made my teeth ache. Crystal by crystal, rack by rack, the pale blue glow dimmed and died. Each column going dark felt like a lock clicking open. Each one was a person unbound.

I thought about Maren Dhol, Brick-Singer, sixteen. Thought about her waking up tomorrow and checking her status pane and finding the claim line gone—just *gone*—and not understanding why, and maybe crying, and maybe laughing, and maybe both at once.

Rack one went dark.

Rack two.

Three.

"Movement upstairs," Ilya's voice crackled through the relay. "Shift change came early. You have four minutes."

Four minutes. Two racks left.

Sable moved faster. Nia moved faster. I stood at the door and did the one thing I could still do without Thread: I watched.

Rack four.

Footsteps above us. Heavy. Multiple.

Rack five.

"Two minutes," Ilya said.

Sable cursed—a word I didn't recognize, which meant it was either freehold slang or something he'd invented for this specific moment of stress. He jammed the purge unit against the final rack and toggled all three switches simultaneously.

The unit screamed.

Not metaphorically. A high-pitched whine that lanced through the vault like a needle through silk. The last rack's crystals shattered—not dimmed, not corrupted, *shattered*—sending splinters of pale blue in every direction. I shielded my face. Nia dropped flat. Sable stood there with broken crystal in his hair and a look of absolute satisfaction.

"Six of six," he said.

"Door on your left," Ilya said. "Emergency maintenance exit. Goes to the canal level. Go *now*."

We went.

---

The canal smelled like industry and old rain and freedom, which is to say it smelled terrible and I loved it.

We ran along the service path until the annex was a block behind us and the night was just night again—cold, dark, full of normal dangers instead of extraordinary ones. Sable split off at the first junction, melting into shadow with the purge unit tucked in his coat and a wink that managed to be both infuriating and endearing.

Nia and I kept moving until we reached the rendezvous point—an abandoned boathouse Hobb had secured through channels I deliberately didn't ask about.

Hobb was there. He looked at us, counted limbs, and grunted.

"Clean?" he said.

"Six racks. All purged," Nia reported. "Crystal destruction on the last one—resonant feedback. Loud. They'll know what happened."

"They were going to know regardless. Speed of discovery is the only variable." He was already packing a kit—papers, signal flags, distribution maps. "I'll have the legal notification printed by dawn. Every person in those records gets told their claim contract is void. Wullen's press, the broadsheet network, courier drops. By the time Concordance responds, the information will be in ten thousand hands."

"Hobb."

He paused.

"Forty-two thousand people," I said.

"I can count, boy."

"I know. I just—" I stopped. The words were there but they felt too big, too clean for the dirty canal light and the adrenaline shakes and the persistent low-grade terror that I might forget this moment by morning. "Thank you. For the maps. The old routes. For keeping things moving when I couldn't."

His jaw worked. "Don't make this—"

"Emotional? Nia already has that rule."

"Then follow it." He picked up the kit. "Get some sleep. Both of you. Tomorrow gets harder."

He left, and the boathouse was quiet except for canal water lapping at wood.

---

I checked my status pane because the numbers were the only honest thing left.

**Thread: 7.6**
**Memory: Stable (no new gaps in 14 hours)**
**Cognitive anchor: Engaged**

No new gaps. Fourteen hours. The rest was working—or the storm was pausing—or my brain had simply run out of things convenient to forget.

"You didn't use Thread in the vault," Nia said.

"Ghost Permission. Once. Point-eight cost."

"And the rest?"

"Watched a door."

She sat beside me on the boathouse floor. Damp wood, cold air, the smell of fish and tar. "You're learning to not be the only thing that matters."

"I was never the only thing that matters."

"You were the only thing that *worked*. That's different. Harder to let go of."

I thought about it. The corridors I couldn't open anymore. The fault lines that moved before I could touch them. The supply flow that Hobb's old maps were already restoring without a single line of Thread.

"Sable's mother," I said.

"Yeah."

"He never mentioned her before."

"Sable doesn't mention things. He deploys them."

"Even grief?"

"Especially grief."

The canal lapped. A barge horn sounded somewhere in the dark, low and mournful and strangely comforting—proof that the city kept moving through every crisis, every lockdown, every storm.

"The crystals are destroyed," I said. "But Ilya said the Spire has copies."

"Copies without originals. Legally challengeable."

"And if the Concordance just ignores the legal challenge?"

"Then forty-two thousand people know their chains are made of paper instead of steel. That's not freedom. But it's the room to *fight* for freedom, which is more than they had yesterday."

She was right. She was usually right about the things that mattered and wrong about the things that didn't, which made her the exact opposite of me.

I pressed the brass disc against my palm. *Kael Voss. Boathouse. Night. Nia beside me. Forty-two thousand names released.*

Hold on to things.

---

Morning brought complications. Morning always brought complications, but this one arrived wearing Ilya's expression of controlled alarm, which was never good.

"The annex vault wasn't the only storage site," she said.

She'd been running analysis on the crystal encoding structure all night—because Ilya's relationship with sleep was adversarial at best—and had found embedded reference tags in the shattered fragments Sable had smuggled out.

"Each crystal contained a replication pointer. A backup address. The originals we destroyed were mirrors of deeper records stored at—" She hesitated. Ilya never hesitated. "Root-linked sites. Maintenance layer vaults connected directly to the lattice infrastructure."

The room went quiet.

"The claim contracts have backups," I said. "In the System itself."

"Not just backups. *Source records.* The crystals we destroyed were the readable copies. The actual binding data lives deeper—encoded into the maintenance layer at sites tied to major lattice nodes."

"So we freed nobody."

"We created legal ambiguity and destroyed the accessible enforcement copies. That matters. But if the Concordance accesses the root-linked backups and reconstructs the registry—"

"How long?" Hobb asked.

"Weeks. Maybe months, if we can interfere with access to the sites. But they'll try."

Sable, who had reappeared with crystal dust still in his hair and two cups of tea produced from nowhere, set one cup in front of Ilya. "Where are these root-linked sites?"

She unfolded a diagram. "Three confirmed. One is beneath the Governance Spire—inaccessible. One is in the old maintenance cathedral under District Four—heavily warded but physically reachable. And one—" She tapped the third point on the diagram.

"Node 9-Black," I said.

She nodded. "The deepest documented lattice node in Veyrun. Connected to root seams. Connected to *everything.*"

Node 9-Black. The place the Custodian's text always seemed to point toward. The place where maintenance layer met root layer met whatever lived beneath both.

The place I'd been trying not to think about since the Custodian told me to stop optimizing.

"Well," I said. "That's not ominous at all."

"It gets worse," Ilya said, because of course it did. "The Concordance knows about the backup sites. They'll be moving to secure them now. If we want to reach Node 9-Black before they seal it permanently—"

"We go down," Nia finished.

"We go down," Ilya confirmed.

I looked at my Thread: 7.6. My anchor: brass and hope. My brain: mostly present, occasionally wandering, held together with stubbornness and a disc that worked sixty percent of the time.

And my people—already planning, already adapting, already building the road that Nia had promised we'd build.

"Then we go down," I said.

**STATUS UPDATE:**
**Location: Veyrun, District 9 (boathouse rendezvous)**
**Registry Burn: Complete (6/6 racks purged)**
**Claim contracts voided: 42,000 (legally challengeable)**
**Complication: Root-linked backup registries discovered**
**Backup sites: 3 (Governance Spire — inaccessible; District 4 Cathedral — reachable; Node 9-Black — deep lattice)**
**Level: 15**
**Thread: 7.6**
**Attention: 34 watchers**
**Memory: Stable (18 hours, no new gaps)**
**Network response: Broadsheet distribution underway. Legal notification in circulation.**
**Next objective: Secure or destroy root-linked backup records before Concordance reconstruction.**
**Personal note: Sable had a mother in those crystals. Hobb had old maps. Nia had patience. I had a door to watch. The resistance doesn't run on Thread. It runs on people who remember why they started.**
**I'm going to remember this. I'm writing it down because I don't trust my head anymore, but I trust ink.**
**Forty-two thousand names. That's not a number. That's a population.**
**We did something real tonight.**
