# Chapter 14 — Knife Logic

Nia threw a bowl at my head at breakfast, which was how I learned we were being hunted.

Not a full bowl. She'd finished the porridge first, because Nia was practical even about violence. The ceramic whistled past my ear and shattered against the doorframe behind me, and in the half-second I spent flinching, she was already across the table with her hand over my mouth.

"Don't talk," she whispered. "Don't move. Look at the window."

I looked.

Across the mud lane, leaning against a rain barrel with the studied casualness of someone who'd been taught surveillance by people who weren't very good at it, stood a man in a courier's coat. Wrong build for a courier—too heavy in the shoulders, too still in the hips. Real couriers never stopped moving. Their bodies forgot how.

"Ragline?" I breathed against her fingers.

She removed her hand and wiped it on my shirt. "Ragline splinter. Fen Morat's crew. They split off after the eastern route war last year—independent operators now. Bounty hunters, mostly."

"How do you know?"

"Because Fen Morat wants me dead, Kael. Has for fourteen months. I just didn't think he'd spend the tokens to find me in the Freeholds."

She said it the way she said most things—flat, informational, like discussing weather that happened to include knives.

"And now he knows I'm with a Nullwright," she continued, pulling on her boots with the brisk efficiency of someone who'd dressed for emergencies since childhood. "Which means the bounty just doubled. Maybe tripled. You're worth more alive than dead, but Fen's people aren't precision instruments."

"What are they?"

"Hammers."

"Great."

"With anger issues."

"Better."

I pulled up my status pane while she armed herself, which took surprisingly long given how many knives she apparently carried at all times. I'd known about three. The true count was closer to nine. Nia's relationship with edged weapons was what scholars might call *comprehensive*.

**ALERT: Unauthorized tracking signature detected**
**Source: Unknown (non-Concordance)**
**Proximity: <200m, converging**
**Count: 4-6 entities**

"Four to six," I said.

"Sounds like Fen. He runs tight crews." She finished lacing her boots and met my eyes. "We can't fight six in a building. Too many angles, too many walls."

"So we run."

"We move. Running implies panic. Moving implies we have a plan."

"Do we have a plan?"

"We have a direction. The canal market is three blocks south. Dense crowds, tight stalls, overhead covers. Hard to coordinate a grab in a space like that."

"And if they follow us in?"

Her jaw set. "Then we make it expensive."

---

We went out the back window because the front door was a murder funnel and I preferred my murders diffuse.

The Freehold morning was grey and damp, the kind of weather that made everything look like a painting someone had breathed on. Fog clung to the canal surface in lazy sheets. Market noise was already building—vendors arguing over stall placement, a goat expressing philosophical objections to a rope.

I dropped from the window ledge into the alley and my Fault-Sight flared before my boots hit mud.

The Freeholds were riddled with environmental seams. Not the deep, dangerous root-layer faults I'd encountered in the Lattice, but shallow mismatches—places where the System's jurisdiction thinned because nobody had bothered to maintain it. Property boundaries that overlapped. Drainage calculations that assumed buildings which no longer existed. Load-bearing predictions based on structures that had been modified seventeen times since the original math.

The Freeholds were, from a System perspective, a headache held together by habit.

From my perspective, they were a toolbox.

"This way," I said, veering left where the alley split.

"That's not toward the market."

"I know. Trust me for thirty seconds."

"I trust you for exactly thirty seconds. Starting now."

I led her through a gap between two buildings that were technically the same building if you believed the property records and two entirely different buildings if you believed your eyes. The seam between them shimmered faintly in Fault-Sight—a relational mismatch where ownership, structural assessment, and spatial allocation all disagreed about whose wall this was.

Behind us, boots splashed in the alley. Close. Too close.

I pulled the diagnostic lens from my coat and held it to my right eye, just for a second. The world cracked open. Through the upper half, environmental faults bloomed like veins—every structural ambiguity, every misallocated boundary, every place where reality was being polite rather than accurate.

Through the lower half—

I put it away. Lower half later. Upper half now.

The pain arrived anyway: a hot wire behind my left eye, familiar now, almost routine. I blinked tears and memorized what I'd seen.

"There's a load-bearing seam forty feet ahead," I told Nia. "Where the canal bridge joins the fishmonger's foundation. The System thinks the bridge supports the wall. The wall thinks it supports itself. Neither is actually right."

"What happens if you poke it?"

"The bridge stays. The wall gets confused about six inches to the left for approximately four seconds."

"Six inches of wall moving four seconds."

"If someone is standing next to it, that's a very bad four seconds."

Nia looked at me. Her expression was the complicated one—the one that mixed tactical appreciation with moral unease with something I couldn't name.

"Can you trigger it on command?" she asked.

"If they chase us across the bridge."

"Then we cross the bridge."

---

They caught us at the bridge.

Not Fen himself—three of his crew, fanned out in a loose triangle that told me they'd done this before. Two men and a woman, all wearing courier leathers that fit badly over combat padding, all carrying the kind of weapons that said "we'd prefer alive but aren't committed to the concept."

The woman had a net launcher. The taller man had a weighted chain. The shorter man had a crossbow with a bolt that hummed with containment energy.

"Nia Serrin," called the woman, not even breathing hard. "Fen sends his regards."

"Fen can send them to my left foot," Nia said.

"He also sends a price. Twelve hundred favor tokens for you. Another two thousand for the glitch-touched boy."

"I'm flattered," I said. "Is that wholesale or retail?"

The woman's eyes flicked to me. Something shifted in her assessment—she'd been told I was cargo, and cargo wasn't supposed to talk back.

"Don't make this complicated," she said.

"I'm a Nullwright. Everything I touch gets complicated. It's occupational."

Nia moved first.

Not toward them. Toward the bridge railing. She vaulted it in one motion, dropping to the lower walkway that ran along the canal surface, and the movement was so unexpected that all three hunters tracked her—which meant all three hunters stopped watching me.

I reached with Thread into the load-bearing seam.

The bridge's relationship to the fishmonger's wall was a polite fiction—the System treating two independent structures as connected because the math was easier that way. I didn't break anything. I just asked a question: *Are you sure?*

The System reconsidered.

For four seconds, the wall shifted.

Not catastrophically. Six inches to the left, exactly as I'd predicted—the foundation hiccupping as structural authority briefly transferred, then transferred back. But six inches of stone wall lurching sideways when you're standing next to it is the difference between ready and sprawling.

The man with the crossbow stumbled into the railing. The bolt discharged into the canal with a hiss of steam. The woman with the net staggered, her aim thrown off, and the net deployed into empty air above the bridge.

Nia came up from below like a blade with opinions.

**EXPLOIT: Structural Authority Displacement**
**Thread Cost: 2.1**
**Duration: 4.2 seconds**
**Signature: Environmental (low detection risk)**
**Attention: +0 (non-Concordance zone)**

She took the chain-fighter first—a low sweep that buckled his knee, then a rising elbow that ended the conversation between his face and consciousness. The net-woman tried to reload, but Nia closed distance faster than the mechanism could cycle and put her into the canal with a shoulder check that looked almost gentle if you didn't notice the knife pressed to the woman's side during the redirect.

The crossbowman recovered, drew a short blade, and turned toward me.

I had no knife. No weapon. No combat class. What I had was Fault-Sight showing me that the boards under his right foot had a moisture-warped nail that was already three-quarters free of its housing.

I stomped the board's far end.

The nail popped. The board tilted. His weight went wrong.

Nia finished him with the kind of efficient violence that made me understand why courier survival rates were what they were.

Silence, except for canal water lapping and the chain-fighter groaning softly in the growing light.

"Four seconds," Nia said, not quite smiling.

"Four point two, technically."

"You exploited a wall."

"I asked a wall a philosophical question and it had a brief crisis."

Now she almost smiled. "That was good timing."

"That was *our* timing."

She looked at me then—really looked, not the tactical scan or the injury check or the assessment of whether I'd do something stupid in the next thirty seconds. Something warmer. Something that acknowledged we'd just done something together that neither of us could have done alone.

"Yeah," she said. "It was."

---

We didn't stay to admire our work. Fen had brought more than three, and the ones who'd hung back would be moving toward the noise.

Nia navigated us through the canal market at speed—a blur of fish stalls, shouting vendors, and one very confused man trying to sell me a hat—while I kept Fault-Sight half-open, scanning for tracking signatures and containment tech.

"Fourteen months," I said, because the quiet bothered me more than the running. "You never mentioned Fen."

"You never asked."

"I'm asking now."

She was quiet for three stalls and a poultry cart.

"I ran Fen's routes for two years," she said finally. "Eastern quarter, cross-district relays, some underworks. Good money. Clean runs, mostly. Then Fen took a contract from someone inside the Concordance to move suppressed records out of a registry annex."

"Quiet Audit material?"

"Before the Audit had a name. Raw files. People erased from class rolls, property records altered, debt histories fabricated. Fen was going to sell them to the highest bidder."

"And you?"

"I copied them first. Gave them to a Patchless contact. For free."

"Fen noticed."

"Fen noticed. I ran. I've been running since." She ducked under a canvas awning. "He doesn't care about the data anymore—it's been distributed, it's worthless. He cares about the principle. You steal from Fen Morat, Fen Morat makes an example."

"Even across Freehold borders."

"Especially across Freehold borders. Letting it go would be bad for business."

I processed this while dodging a crate of what I dearly hoped were fish. "So your past involves distributing stolen evidence of institutional corruption to underground resistance networks."

"Yes."

"And mine involves being a walking System malfunction."

"Yes."

"We're a very normal pair."

She snorted—the closest Nia came to a belly laugh. "You know what Fen calls people like us? Loose threads. Things that should've been tied off but weren't."

"How poetic."

"How accurate."

We emerged from the market onto a raised walkway overlooking the eastern canal, where the fog was finally thinning and the Freehold's crooked skyline was sharpening into focus. No pursuit visible. No tracking signatures in range.

I leaned against the railing and let my breathing slow.

"We need to tell the others," I said.

"I know."

"If Fen tracked you here, he tracked us to Blackmoss Hall. Reva's territory. She'll want to know someone brought a bounty into her borders."

Nia nodded. Her face was the careful blank she used when emotions got too close to the surface—a mask so practiced it was almost invisible unless you'd learned to read what the absence meant.

"Kael."

"Yeah?"

"The wall thing. The seam exploit. You planned that while we were moving."

"I planned it the moment I saw the fault lines. About two minutes before they caught us."

"You saw the environment and thought *weapon*."

"I saw the environment and thought *option*. You're the one who made it a weapon."

She stared at me for a beat longer than comfortable. "That's the first time someone's used their abilities to set me up instead of trying to use me as a distraction."

The sentence landed heavier than she probably intended. I heard the history in it—years of running with people who saw her speed and knives as tools and her survival as optional.

"Get used to it," I said.

She turned away, but not before I saw something crack in the mask. Something that might have been trust, or the terrifying precursor to it.

A notification pulsed at the edge of my vision.

**COMBAT SYNERGY NOTED**
**Coordination efficiency: Environmental exploit → tactical follow-up**
**Pattern: Novel (no prior match)**
**Recommendation: Repeated engagement may develop class-adjacent tactical bonding**
**Warning: Interdependence increases shared risk profile**

Shared risk profile.

The System had a gift for making human connection sound like a liability.

I dismissed the notification and followed Nia toward Blackmoss Hall, where Ilya was going to be furious and Hobb was going to pretend he wasn't worried and Sable was going to calculate the exact market value of our continued survival.

Just another morning in the Freeholds.

At least nobody had stolen my breakfast this time.

Well. Nia had thrown it. Close enough.
