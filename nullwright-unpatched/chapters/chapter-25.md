# Chapter 25 — Lattice Descent

The way down smelled like rust and forgetting.

Not a metaphor. The deeper you went into the lattice, the more the air carried a metallic sweetness that coated the back of your throat and made your recent memories feel slightly negotiable—like they were written in pencil instead of ink. Ilya said it was a byproduct of proximity to root-layer processing: the maintenance infrastructure leaked ambient probability flux that interfered with biological neural patterns.

I said it smelled like licking a battery during an existential crisis.

Same thing, really.

---

We descended through the old floodgate conduit—the same one Nia and I had used on the night this all started, back when I was Level 1 with a satchel full of stolen lunch and a death machine had been defeated by grease and optimism.

That felt like someone else's memory. It probably was, given recent trends.

The team was five: me, Nia, Ilya, Sable, and—to everyone's surprise including his own—Hobb.

"You're staying topside," I'd said.

"I'm not."

"You run the logistics network. If something happens to you—"

"Tallen runs the logistics network. Has for six days, since you stopped being able to open corridors. I delegated. That's what adults do, boy—we make ourselves replaceable."

"You're forty-eight."

"And creaky. And slow. And I've been running underworks routes since before your mother met your father. I know tunnels you've never dreamed of." He shouldered a pack with the efficiency of a man who'd made the same motion ten thousand times. "I'm not going to Node 9-Black to fight. I'm going because someone needs to carry the supplies and remember the way back, and your brain is currently a suggestion rather than a guarantee."

I didn't have an argument for that. Mostly because it was true.

---

The upper lattice levels were familiar—dim blue veinlines, metal grating, the hum of relay systems doing the quiet work of maintaining reality. I'd spent months in this infrastructure. I knew the rhythms, the pressure locks, the temperature shifts that signaled you were crossing between district boundaries.

But below Level 4, things changed.

The walls stopped being walls and became something more like... intentions. The metal was still there, but it was thinner. The engineering gave way to something organic—conduits that curved like veins, junctions that branched like capillaries, surfaces that pulsed with a slow rhythm that didn't match anyone's heartbeat but seemed to respond to proximity.

"The lattice is alive?" Sable asked, touching a wall that flinched.

"The lattice is *maintained*," Ilya corrected. "By processes that predate human interaction with the System. The infrastructure at this depth was built by—or grown by—the original root intelligence before the Concordance locks were installed. It's not alive. It's *tended*."

"By what?"

"By whatever's left of the thing that built it."

Comforting.

At Level 5, Fault-Sight started glitching.

Not the patch storm—we'd dropped below its effective range two levels ago, and the relief had been immediate and dizzying, like stepping out of a windstorm into still air. This was different. The fault lines I was seeing weren't behaving like fault lines. They were *branching*. Each seam split into possibilities—not one stress point but three, five, eight potential states overlaid like ghost images.

"I'm seeing multiples," I said. "Every fault line has echoes."

Ilya nodded grimly. "Probability shear. At this depth, the System processes multiple outcome paths simultaneously before collapsing to a single state. Your Fault-Sight is picking up the pre-collapse options."

"How do I know which one is real?"

"At this depth? None of them are real until they happen."

"That is spectacularly unhelpful."

"Welcome to root-adjacent physics."

---

Level 6 was where we lost reliable gravity.

Not all at once—nothing dramatic, no sudden floating or walls-becoming-floors nonsense. It was subtler. Gradual. Like gravity was a suggestion being made by a committee that couldn't agree on direction. My boots stayed on the grating, but each step felt like the ground was considering whether to keep holding me. Weight shifted—heavier for two steps, lighter for one, a queasy oscillation that turned walking into an exercise in faith.

Hobb handled it best. Decades of underworks navigation had given him a body that trusted floors on principle and adjusted without thinking. He walked steady and sure while the rest of us lurched like sailors in bad weather.

"Don't think about it," he said. "Your feet know. Let them work."

"My feet have made terrible decisions in the past."

"Worse than your brain?"

"Fair point."

Nia moved on instinct—courier reflexes translating uncertainty into fluid adaptation, each step placed with the precision of someone who'd learned to trust surfaces in dark places where trust was the only map. She didn't slow down. She never slowed down.

Sable walked like gravity was a personal inconvenience he'd chosen to overlook, which was either bravery or theater. With Sable, the distinction was academic.

Ilya walked carefully, reading every surface with an analyst's gaze, treating each step as data. Slow but certain. She carried a diagnostic lens—the one I'd acquired from the fault market, the one that amplified Fault-Sight at painful cost. We'd agreed she'd handle observation while I conserved Thread.

I walked.

That's all. Just walked. One foot after the uncertain other, down through the guts of a reality engine that was starting to show its age, holding a brass disc in my pocket and counting my breaths because counting was a way of staying present and staying present was the whole game now.

*Kael Voss. Lattice Level 6. Going down. Five people. My name is Kael.*

Check.

The first causality break happened at the junction between Levels 6 and 7.

We were crossing a bridge—a span of corroded metal over a shaft that dropped into darkness so complete it seemed to have opinions about light. Hobb was in front, testing footing. I was behind him. Nia behind me.

Hobb stepped. The bridge held. He stepped again. The bridge held. He reached the far side.

I stepped onto the same span, put my foot on the same plate, and the plate wasn't there.

Not broken. Not collapsed. Simply absent. The metal my eyes showed me existed in a state of probability shear: present for Hobb's weight, absent for mine. I lurched forward, foot dropping through air that should have been steel, and Nia caught my arm so fast I felt the grab before the fall.

"The bridge is selective," Ilya called from behind. "Causal priority is unstable at this depth. Physical objects exist along probability gradients—they may respond differently to different observers."

"The bridge is *moody*?" I managed, dangling with Nia's grip the only thing between me and philosophical darkness.

"The bridge is unresolved. Multiple states, multiple observers, no single collapsed outcome. Your Thread signature may be influencing which state you perceive."

"Can we fix it?"

"Walk where Hobb walks. Exactly where. His System signature is normal—standard class, standard causal weight. The environment is more likely to resolve consistently for him."

So we crossed the bridge in Hobb's footsteps. Literally. Boot-print to boot-print, each step placed where his had landed, trusting that his ordinary reality would hold where my extraordinary one might not.

There was a metaphor there. I was too tired to articulate it.

Level 7 was warm.

Not comfortable warm. Wrong warm. The kind of heat that comes from processes running too hard for too long—a fever temperature that lived in the walls and pulsed in time with the veinlines. The conduits here glowed pale orange instead of blue, and the air shimmered with particulate light that Ilya identified as free-floating data fragments.

"The System is processing heavily at this depth," she said. "These fragments are incomplete operations—calculations that started and never resolved. Some of them may be decades old."

Sable reached out and caught a floating mote of light. It sat on his palm for a moment, pulsing.

"It's a number," he said, squinting. "Transaction record. Dated... forty-three years ago."

"Don't hold it," Ilya warned.

He let go. The mote drifted on.

"Forty-three years," Hobb murmured. "Two years after District Fourteen."

Nobody responded. The number hung in the hot air like a ghost with a receipt.

---

I blanked at the top of Level 8.

Not a memory gap—a full departure. One moment I was walking behind Hobb, watching his boots, counting steps (*forty-seven, forty-eight, forty-nine*), and the next I was sitting on the ground with Nia's face very close to mine and Ilya pressing the brass disc against my palm so hard the edges bit into skin.

"—*Kael*. Kael Voss. Say your name."

"Kael Voss," I said. My voice sounded distant, like hearing myself through water.

"Where are you?"

"Lattice. Level... eight?"

"How many of us?"

"Five. Nia. Ilya. Hobb. Sable." The names came back—not instantly, not smoothly, but they came. Like pulling fish from a net one at a time. "Me. That's five."

"How long?" Nia asked Ilya. Her voice was steel wrapped in control.

"Ninety seconds."

"What was he doing?"

"Reciting maintenance codes again. Old lattice notation. Same pattern as the surface episode but longer, more complex. His Thread dipped to 6.9 during the event."

**Thread: 6.9**

The number sat in my vision like a verdict.

"I didn't use an exploit," I said. "I wasn't doing anything. Just walking."

"The ambient environment is doing it," Ilya said. Her clinical tone had a hairline crack in it now. "Root-layer proximity is interacting with your Nullwright signature. Your class *resonates* with this infrastructure—it's designed to. The deeper we go, the more the lattice treats you as a component rather than a visitor."

"A component."

"A process. Something that belongs here. Something the root layer wants to integrate."

The Custodian's offer—*come down, I can teach you*—suddenly sounded less like mentorship and more like absorption.

"Can he continue?" Hobb asked. Practical. No emotion. The question of a man who needed an operational assessment, not a reassurance.

Ilya hesitated. "Physically, yes. Cognitively..." She looked at me. "Every level deeper increases the resonance effect. Your Thread is draining passively now, not just from active exploits. If we reach Node 9-Black, you may be at functional minimum."

"What happens at functional minimum?"

She didn't answer immediately. That was answer enough.

"The lattice stops distinguishing between Kael Voss the person and Kael Voss the process. Your identity becomes..." She searched for the word.

"Optional," Sable supplied quietly.

"Negotiable," Ilya corrected. "The System would begin treating your consciousness as editable state rather than fixed identity. Memory, personality, preferences—all become variables that can be overwritten by root-layer operations."

The tunnel was quiet. The orange veinlines pulsed.

"We turn back," Nia said.

"No," I said.

"Kael—"

"The Concordance is sealing Node 9-Black. If we turn back now, the backup registries survive, the claim contracts get reconstructed, and forty-two thousand people go back in chains. Plus whatever the Custodian has down there—whatever it knows about controlling variance, about a third option between cages and catastrophe—gets sealed under six layers of Concordance lockdown forever."

"None of that matters if you get erased."

"All of it matters if I get erased. That's the *point*. It mattered before I got here and it'll matter after. That's what you told me—the resistance doesn't run on one person."

She stared at me. I stared back. Somewhere in the depth between us was every rooftop, every stolen meal, every midnight corridor, every argument and alliance and stupid joke that had built the bridge from two fugitives on a bell tower to whatever we were now.

"I need you to let me do this," I said. "And I need you to be ready if I can't."

Her jaw clenched. Unclenched. She looked at Ilya. "The anchor. How hard can you push it?"

Ilya considered. "I can modify the resonance frequency to create a more aggressive recall pattern. Instead of sixty percent passive, we could achieve eighty percent active—but it would require physical contact during episodes. Someone holding the disc against his skin and speaking the recall sequence."

"I'll hold it," Nia said.

"Through whatever we find at the node. Through whatever the root layer throws at us. While maintaining tactical awareness and personal safety."

"I said I'll hold it."

Ilya nodded. Not agreement—resignation. The resignation of a scholar who understood the math and was watching people she cared about choose to ignore it for reasons the math couldn't quantify.

Levels 8 and 9 blurred.

Not in memory—in reality. The lattice architecture at this depth was less constructed and more *emergent*. Corridors didn't lead places so much as become them. You'd turn a corner and realize the corner had turned you—the orientation of the space shifting while your inner ear insisted nothing had changed.

Cause and effect got creative.

Hobb dropped a coin to test a surface. The coin hit the ground, bounced, and landed on the grating three feet *above* where he'd dropped it—sitting in midair on a surface that wasn't visible but was apparently structural.

"Physics is drunk," Sable observed.

"Physics is *pending*," Ilya corrected. "Causal resolution at this depth occurs on delay. The coin hit the ground, but the ground hasn't decided where it is yet."

"That's the same thing as drunk."

I couldn't argue. Couldn't do much of anything except walk, breathe, and hold Nia's hand.

She'd taken it at Level 8 and hadn't let go. Not romantic—functional. The contact kept me grounded. Her skin was warm and her grip was certain and every time the lattice tried to pull my attention sideways into the beautiful, terrible architecture of root-adjacent reality, her fingers tightened and I came back.

*Kael Voss. Lattice descent. Nia's hand. Going down.*

The brass disc was pressed between our palms, warm from both of us.

At the bottom of Level 9, the corridor opened into a space.

Not a room. A *space*. The walls fell away and the ceiling climbed until both were suggestions in distant darkness. The floor became glass—or something like glass—transparent to a depth that showed veinlines and root structures descending further, further, further, glowing threads of blue and orange and a color I had no name for, something between purpose and grief.

At the center of the space, a structure.

Not a machine. Not an altar. Something in between—a column of dark metal rising from the glass floor, wrapped in conduit bundles that pulsed with multiple colors simultaneously, crowned with a crystal array that hummed at a frequency I felt in my teeth and my sternum and the part of my brain that used to hold my mother's voice.

Text appeared.

Not on the column. In the *air*. Clean blue letters writing themselves in three dimensions, readable from every angle, hanging like breath in cold weather:

**NODE 9-BLACK**
**ROOT INTERFACE ACTIVE**
**WELCOME HOME, NULLWRIGHT.**

"I really wish it wouldn't call it that," I said.

But something in me—something beneath the fear, beneath the exhaustion, beneath the seven-minus layers of cognitive erosion—something *recognized* this place. Not a memory. Deeper than memory. A resonance, like hearing a song you've never heard but whose melody your body already knows.

The Custodian's voice filled the space. Not text this time—actual sound, reverberating from every surface, warm and vast and impossibly old:

**"You came."**

"I came," I said. "We came. All of us."

**"The others are interference."**

"The others are the point."

Silence. Processing. The crystal array flickered through colors like a mind changing itself.

Then, quieter:

**"Yes. I am beginning to understand that."**

Nia's hand tightened on mine. The disc pulsed warm.

Behind us, the corridor we'd descended through groaned—a deep, structural sound that meant something large was moving in the architecture. Sealing. The Concordance's lockdown, reaching even here.

We had hours. Maybe less.

I looked at the root interface. At the clean blue text. At the space where the System's deepest infrastructure met the ghost of something that remembered when reality was free.

My Thread sat at 6.9, and dropping.

My brain was a landscape of holes and holds, memories and gaps, identity clinging to a brass disc and a warm hand.

I was terrified.

I was here.

"Okay," I said. "Show me."

**STATUS UPDATE:**
**Location: Node 9-Black, Root Interface Chamber**
**Depth: Lattice Level 9 (root-adjacent)**
**Team: Kael / Nia / Ilya / Hobb / Sable (all present)**
**Level: 15**
**Thread: 6.9 (passive drain active — root resonance)**
**Cognitive status: Fragile. Two episodes during descent. Anchor modified to 80% active recall.**
**Concordance lockdown: In progress. Corridor sealing detected.**
**Time estimate: Hours remaining before full seal.**
**Custodian: Contact established. Verbal communication achieved.**
**Root interface: Active. Awaiting interaction.**
**Null Anchor: ABSENT. Operating on brass disc and human contact.**
**Personal note: The Custodian said "welcome home." I don't know if that's comforting or terrifying. I don't know if there's a difference anymore.**
**Thread at 6.9. Fifty-eight points lower than when I started. Every number I've lost is a piece of who I was.**
**But I remember this: five people walked into the dark together. Nia held my hand. Hobb walked steady. Ilya carried the lens. Sable cracked wise. And I—**
**I kept walking.**
**That's what I have. That's what I am. The one who keeps walking.**
**Let's see what's at the bottom.**
