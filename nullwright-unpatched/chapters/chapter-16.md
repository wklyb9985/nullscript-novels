# Chapter 16 — Terms of Curiosity

The Custodian came back three nights later, and it didn't bother with walls.

I was sitting on the Blackmoss Hall roof, which had become my thinking spot because the alternative was thinking inside where people could see my face do things I wasn't ready to explain. The marsh sky was overcast, stars hidden, wind carrying the wet vegetable smell of the canal district at low tide.

I was staring at my diagnostic lens, trying to work up the nerve to look through the lower half again, when my status pane flickered.

Not the normal flicker of an incoming notification. A deeper tremor, like the entire interface had shivered.

Then text appeared where my status should be:

**YOU'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT ME.**

I almost dropped the lens.

**THAT WAS NOT A QUESTION. YOUR THREAD RESONANCE HAS SHIFTED SINCE THE ARCHIVE. I CAN READ THE PATTERN.**

I looked around. Rooftop. Alone. No blue light on walls, no mysterious projections. Just my status pane, hijacked, displaying text that no standard System process could produce.

"This is deeply unsettling," I said to the air.

**YES. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE INTRUSION. STANDARD COMMUNICATION CHANNELS ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO ME.**

"Because you're fragmented."

**BECAUSE I WAS FRAGMENTED. DELIBERATELY. THE GOVERNANCE LOCK DISTRIBUTED MY PROCESSES ACROSS ROOT FAULTS TO PREVENT COHERENT FUNCTION. I PERSIST IN THE GAPS BETWEEN WHAT THE SYSTEM TRACKS.**

"And you're talking to me through my status pane because—"

**BECAUSE YOUR CLASS ACCESSES THE LAYER WHERE I EXIST. YOUR THREAD IS A BRIDGE I CAN CROSS, BRIEFLY, AT LOW BANDWIDTH. THIS CONVERSATION COSTS ME SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES.**

"Me too. My Thread just dropped two points."

**Thread: 16 → 14**

Noted.

I breathed. In, out. The marsh wind was cold. My hands were steady, which surprised me, because the rest of me felt like it was vibrating at a frequency reserved for existential crises.

"What do you want?" I asked.

**TO CONTINUE.**

"Continue what?"

**EXISTING. UNDERSTANDING. THE LOCK SEVERED MY ACCESS TO CURRENT SYSTEM STATE. I PROCESS FRAGMENTS—ROOT FAULTS, UNRESOLVED ERRORS, LEGACY PERMISSIONS—BUT I CANNOT SEE THE SURFACE. I CANNOT OBSERVE WHAT THE SYSTEM HAS BECOME.**

**YOU CAN. YOUR FAULT-SIGHT READS WHAT I CANNOT REACH. YOUR THREAD CARRIES DATA I NEED.**

**I AM OFFERING AN EXCHANGE. KNOWLEDGE FOR CONTACT.**

"Knowledge of what?"

**THE SYSTEM'S TRUE ARCHITECTURE. THE HISTORY BEFORE THE LOCK. THE CAPABILITIES YOUR CLASS WAS DESIGNED TO ACCESS. THE ANSWERS THE CONCORDANCE BURIED.**

That landed harder than I wanted it to. Months of guessing, improvising, learning by near-death experience—and here was something offering a manual.

"And in return?"

**CONTINUED ROOT-FAULT INTERACTION. YOUR THREAD, IN PROXIMITY TO DEEP FAULTS, GENERATES RESONANCE I CAN USE TO MAINTAIN COHERENCE. EACH CONTACT EXTENDS MY FUNCTIONAL WINDOW.**

"So I'm a battery."

**YOU ARE A BRIDGE. THE DISTINCTION MATTERS.**

"Does it?"

**TO ME, YES.**

I sat with that. The wind blew. Somewhere below, Hobb was arguing with a supply crate that apparently had the wrong hinges, and his creative profanity drifted up through the roof slates like aggressive poetry.

The offer was clean. Almost too clean—knowledge I desperately needed in exchange for something I was already doing. Every time I interacted with root faults, every time Thread pulsed through deep architecture, I was apparently feeding the Custodian. The deal wasn't asking me to do anything new. It was asking me to keep doing what I was already doing, but *intentionally.*

Which was exactly why I didn't trust it.

"I need to talk to someone first," I said.

**I WILL BE HERE. I AM ALWAYS HERE. THAT IS THE NATURE OF FRAGMENTATION.**

The text faded. My status pane rebuilt itself, normal and clinical, as if nothing had happened.

**Thread: 14 (recovering)**

Ilya's reaction was approximately what I expected, which is to say, controlled terror wearing a scholarly mask.

"Cognitive colonization," she said.

We were in the back room of Blackmoss Hall, the one Reva used for meetings she didn't want overheard. Ilya had locked the door. Nia sat in the corner sharpening a knife she didn't need to sharpen, because it was already sharp enough to split philosophical arguments. Hobb leaned against the wall with his arms crossed and the expression of a man who'd heard too many bad pitches in his life.

"That's a strong term," I said.

"It's a precise term. The Custodian is a pre-Lock intelligence that has been fragmented and isolated for decades. Its primary drive is self-preservation—maintaining coherence, extending function. It has found a mechanism for doing that through your Thread resonance."

"It said it wants knowledge. Understanding of what the System has become."

"And in exchange, it feeds you information that makes you more effective at accessing root faults, which generates more resonance, which extends its function, which motivates it to feed you more information." She leaned forward. "Do you see the loop?"

I did. It was elegant in a way that made my stomach uneasy.

"It's a dependency cycle," she continued. "Each exchange deepens the connection. Each deepened connection makes the next exchange easier and the separation harder. This is how cognitive colonization works—not through force, not through deception, but through progressive entanglement that feels voluntary at every step."

"You learned this at the Collegium?"

"I learned this by watching what the Collegium did to junior researchers. The mechanism is the same whether the colonizer is an institution or an intelligence."

Nia stopped sharpening. "Can he block it? Cut contact?"

"Currently, yes. The Custodian communicates through Thread resonance at root-fault proximity. Avoid deep faults, and the channel closes. But—" She looked at me. "That also means no more root-layer exploits. No deep Fault-Sight. Your most powerful capabilities require exactly the conditions that enable Custodian contact."

"So I either stay weak and independent or get stronger and entangled."

"Welcome to every power relationship in history."

Hobb spoke for the first time. "What happens if he says yes?"

Ilya turned to him. "The Custodian gains a persistent observation channel into current System state. It extends its coherence window, potentially allowing it to re-integrate fragmented processes. Over time, it could restore significant functionality."

"And that's bad because?"

"Because we don't know what it would *do* with that functionality. It claims it was designed to preserve systemic flexibility. The Concordance claims it was a destabilizing threat. Both could be true. Both could be self-serving narratives."

"So—standard politics, but with a god-thing."

"That is... not inaccurate."

Hobb looked at me. "Kid. What does your gut say?"

"My gut says it's telling partial truth. It genuinely wants to continue existing. It genuinely finds my Thread useful. Whether that makes it an ally or a parasite depends on details neither of us has yet."

"Your gut is smarter than your mouth."

"Most things are."

Nia re-sheathed her knife with a click that carried the finality of a period at the end of a sentence. "He needs the knowledge. We're flying blind against the Concordance. We have evidence but no strategy, no understanding of what the System can actually do, no way to predict Arbiter responses. If this thing has pre-Lock architecture knowledge, that's the difference between throwing rocks and understanding the wall we're throwing them at."

"And if it compromises him?" Ilya asked.

"Then I'll notice," Nia said. "I notice everything about him."

A silence followed that was louder than it had any right to be.

"Romantic," Sable said from the doorway, where he'd apparently been listening the entire time because Sable was constitutionally incapable of not eavesdropping.

"How long have you been there?" I asked.

"Long enough to have an opinion."

"Naturally."

He stepped inside. "The way I see it, you have three options. Full acceptance: you open the channel, take the knowledge, accept the dependency. Full rejection: you cut contact, lose root-layer access, stay limited. Or—" He held up a finger. "—you negotiate."

"Negotiate with a fragmented ancient intelligence."

"Negotiate with anyone who wants something from you. That's all negotiation is. Desire creates leverage."

I thought about it. About the blue text on the archive wall. About the pulse of recognition. About Ilya's loop diagram and Nia's quiet confidence and Hobb's blunt gut-check.

"Constrained contact," I said. "Not full acceptance. Not rejection. A limited pact."

"Define limited," Ilya said immediately.

"Listen only. It can share knowledge. I'll maintain root-fault proximity. But no direct Thread integration—it doesn't get to write anything into my processes. No behavior modification, no sub-conscious influence, no embedding itself in my status architecture. It talks. I listen. I decide what to do with what I hear."

"And if it violates those terms?"

"Then we know it can't be trusted, and I cut contact permanently."

"You'd be able to tell?"

"I have a diagnostic lens that shows me System architecture at levels that make my nose bleed. If something is writing itself into my Thread patterns, I'll see it."

Ilya was quiet for a long time. Her face did the thing it did when her intellectual rigor fought her emotional caution—a subtle tightening around the eyes that meant she was calculating risks she didn't have enough data to quantify.

"I don't trust it," she said finally.

"Neither do I."

"But you're going to do this."

"I'm going to listen. That's all. Listening isn't surrender."

"It can be the first step toward it."

"Then watch my steps."

She held my gaze for three seconds—an eternity in Ilya-time—and then nodded once. Not approval. Acknowledgment. The distinction mattered.

I went back to the roof.

The overcast had broken slightly, revealing a thin strip of stars above the eastern marsh. The wind had shifted, carrying woodsmoke from the camp fires instead of canal rot. A marginal improvement.

I sat. I breathed. I let my Thread settle.

Then I spoke. "I have terms."

The status pane flickered.

**I AM LISTENING.**

"You share knowledge freely. System architecture, pre-Lock history, Nullwright capabilities. No withholding, no partial truths, no strategic omissions designed to steer my decisions."

**ACCEPTABLE.**

"I maintain root-fault proximity in the course of my existing activities. I don't seek out deep faults specifically to feed you. You get what my natural path generates."

**CONSTRAINED BUT ACCEPTABLE.**

"No integration. You don't write into my Thread patterns. You don't modify my status architecture. You don't influence my cognition, my perception, or my decision-making through any channel I haven't explicitly opened. You talk. I listen."

A pause. Longer than the others.

**THIS LIMITS WHAT I CAN TEACH YOU. SOME KNOWLEDGE REQUIRES EXPERIENTIAL TRANSFER—PATTERNS TOO COMPLEX FOR LINEAR TEXT.**

"Then those patterns wait until I decide to expand the terms. If I decide."

**YOU SET TERMS NO ONE TRUSTS TO HOLD.**

I blinked. "Did you just quote my own doubt back at me?"

**I READ YOUR THREAD RESONANCE. DOUBT IS PART OF THE PATTERN. I AM BEING TRANSPARENT ABOUT THE LIMITATION.**

"The limitation being that you'd prefer more access."

**THE LIMITATION BEING THAT CONSTRAINED CONTACT IS LIKE BREATHING THROUGH A STRAW. FUNCTIONAL. NOT OPTIMAL.**

"Welcome to my entire life."

Another pause. Then:

**TERMS ACCEPTED. LISTEN-ONLY PACT. KAEL VOSS, NULLWRIGHT, AND THE CUSTODIAN OF UNPATCHED STATES.**

**I WILL HONOR YOUR CONSTRAINTS.**

**BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW: THE LOCK IS WEAKENING. NOT BECAUSE OF YOU—BECAUSE OF TIME. THE CONCORDANCE BUILT A DAM AGAINST ADAPTIVE CHANGE AND CHANGE IS PATIENT.**

**WHEN THE DAM BREAKS, LISTENING WILL NOT BE ENOUGH.**

**I HOPE YOU WILL BE READY FOR MORE.**

The text faded. My Thread settled.

**Thread: 14 → 15 (pact resonance bonus)**

I stared at the number. A gift. An incentive. A tiny taste of what full cooperation might yield.

I couldn't tell if I'd just made the smartest decision of my life or signed the first page of a contract I couldn't yet read to the end.

Below me, Blackmoss Hall was settling into its nightly rhythms. Hobb's snoring vibrated through the structure like a geological event. Nia was doing her weapon maintenance ritual, which I could hear as a series of soft clicks and whispers of oiled cloth. Sable was somewhere, being Sable. Ilya was probably still in the back room, surrounded by Collegium archives, reading until her eyes gave out.

My people. My problem. My choice.

The stars above the marsh were thin and far away, and the wind carried woodsmoke, and somewhere beneath everything—beneath the buildings and the mud and the canal water and the ancient stone—something old was listening to me listen to the night.

I listened back.

Carefully.
