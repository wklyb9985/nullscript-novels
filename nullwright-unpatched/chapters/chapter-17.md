# Chapter 17 — Back Through the Teeth

There's a particular kind of stupid that comes with going back to the place that's trying to kill you. Not the hot, impulsive kind—that's just panic with ambition. This was the cold, calculated kind, where you look at the math, understand the odds, and walk in anyway because the alternative is worse.

The alternative was letting four thousand erased names stay rumor instead of becoming revolution.

"The sealed channels were closed during the Governance Expansion," Ilya explained, pointing at a map that Sable had acquired through means he described as "creative networking" and I suspected involved at minimum three lies and one stolen bottle of wine. "Veyrun's undercity has redundant infrastructure from three different construction periods. The oldest channels predate Concordance authority entirely—they run beneath the jurisdictional layer."

"Beneath it," I repeated. "As in, the System doesn't know they're there?"

"As in, the System knows they exist but has classified them as geological features rather than transit routes. An administrative fiction that was convenient sixty years ago and never corrected."

"We're going to sneak into a locked-down city through a bureaucratic error."

"Through an *institutional oversight that persisted because correction would require admitting the error existed.*"

"So—government."

"Exactly."

Nia studied the map with the intensity of a courier memorizing a death route. "Entry point?"

"Here." Ilya tapped a location on the eastern approach—a drainage outflow where the marsh met Veyrun's outer wall. "The old channel connects to sub-level three of the canal district. We surface inside the market quarter, two blocks from Master Hobb's former territory."

"Former," Hobb said. The word sat heavy.

He was coming with us. All of us were. The Freeholds had served their purpose—shelter, training, recovery—but the evidence we carried needed to reach people who could use it, and those people were inside Veyrun's walls, living under Concordance lockdown and wondering if anyone was coming back.

"Former for now," I told him. "We're going to change that."

He gave me the look—the one that mixed skepticism with something he'd never admit was hope. "You sound like a recruitment poster."

"I sound like someone who owes you three months of back rent on a cot above a grocer's shop."

"Four months."

"I was rounding optimistically."

---

We entered the channel at dusk.

The drainage outflow was exactly as romantic as it sounds—a stone mouth crusted with decades of organic deposits that I chose not to identify, belching a thin stream of water that smelled like the city's collective regret. Ilya had warned us about the smell. She had not adequately prepared us.

"This is significantly worse than the marshline exit," Nia said, which for Nia was practically a dramatic monologue.

"Historical authenticity," Sable offered. "Old Veyrun didn't believe in sewage management so much as aggressive relocation."

"Of sewage?"

"Of everything. It's the city's core philosophy."

We moved single file: Nia leading, me second with Fault-Sight running, Ilya third with her light crystal dimmed to minimum, Hobb fourth carrying supplies with the grim efficiency of a man who'd moved stock through worse, and Sable last because someone needed to watch our backs and Sable's paranoia was a civic resource.

The channel narrowed as it angled downward, transitioning from crude drainage to older stonework—the pre-Concordance construction Ilya had described. Precisely cut blocks. Geometric joints. An engineering sensibility that valued permanence over aesthetics.

My Fault-Sight mapped the architecture ahead in soft red lines. The channel's System classification was exactly what Ilya had said: *geological feature, non-transit, maintenance priority zero*. The Concordance's own records said this wasn't a path. We were walking through an administrative blind spot.

"How far?" Nia whispered.

"Two miles to the surface junction," Ilya said. "If the interior hasn't collapsed."

"If."

"I said probability favors us."

"You said that about the archive maintenance shaft too."

"And I was correct."

"One for one isn't a trend."

I liked listening to them argue. It had the rhythm of two competent people who respected each other enough to sharpen their edges against one another—different from the banter between Nia and me, which was affection wearing combat boots, or between Hobb and everyone, which was love disguised as complaints.

We walked. The channel leveled out, then angled upward. The stone grew drier, cleaner. Old light-rods embedded in the walls had died decades ago, but the crystal housings still caught Ilya's light and scattered it in faint prismatic arcs.

At the one-mile mark, I felt something shift.

Not physical. Systemic. A change in the ambient architecture—a thickening of the permission layer overhead, like walking under a ceiling that was slowly lowering. We were passing beneath Veyrun's jurisdictional boundary. The Concordance's authority wasn't visible here, in the administrative blind spot, but I could feel its weight above us like weather.

"We're under the wall," I said.

Hobb paused. Looked up. Looked at me. "You can feel it?"

"I can feel the System getting heavier. More rules per cubic foot."

"Kid, that's just Veyrun."

Fair point.

We kept moving.

---

The surface junction was a vertical shaft with iron rungs that opened into the basement of a building Ilya identified as a decommissioned water management office. The ground floor was empty—stripped of furnishings, windows boarded, marked with Concordance seal tape that was peeling and faded.

We emerged into Veyrun at full dark.

The city hit me like a smell you'd forgotten—canal water, coal smoke, baking bread from the night shift bakeries, the metallic undertone of ward energy buzzing through every major intersection. Home. Or what had been home before home decided I was a civic reality threat.

Nia went to the window and scanned the street. "Patrol pattern is different. Wider sweeps, fewer checkpoints. They've shifted from containment to monitoring."

"Because they think we're gone," Sable said. "The Freehold exodus worked. They moved resources to the eastern border expecting an external approach, not a return through sealed channels."

"How long before they realize?"

"Depends on how quiet we are."

Everyone looked at me.

"I resent the implication," I said. "I can be quiet."

"You exploited a wall loud enough to relocate a building," Nia said.

"That was one time."

"It was three days ago."

"Growth is a process."

Hobb was already at the door, peering through the crack at the street outside. His face had changed—not softer, never softer, but settled. This was his district. His territory. His streets. He knew every building, every alley, every shopkeeper and their spouse's opinions about weather and politics and the correct firmness of bread.

"Tallen's bakery is still running," he murmured. "Night shift light is on. And Resk's hardware—the signal board is up. He only puts it up when he's open for under-counter trade."

"You can tell that from a door crack?"

"I can tell that because I've been reading this street for twenty years, and the only thing that changes is which problems people are pretending don't exist."

He turned to us. The grim set of his jaw had shifted into something more purposeful—the face of a man who'd spent months waiting and had finally been given permission to work.

"Give me forty-eight hours," he said.

"For what?" Ilya asked.

"A network. Not underground. Not smugglers. The people who actually make this district function—bakers, hardware sellers, laundry operators, canal maintenance crews. People who see everything and are seen by nobody because the Concordance doesn't consider them strategically relevant."

"A supply chain," Sable said, his eyes doing the value-calculation thing.

"A logistics net. Distribution points for the Quiet Audit data. Safe houses for people who need to disappear for a day. Message relays that don't use crystals or kiosks—word of mouth through people who trade gossip like currency anyway." Hobb straightened. "The Concordance watches guilds. Watches couriers. Watches scholars and fighters and anyone with a visible class. They don't watch the people who stock their shelves and mend their clothes."

"Because they don't think those people matter," I said.

"Because they forgot that infrastructure is power." He gave me a look that was almost teaching. Almost. "You break systems from the code, kid. I break them from the inventory."

I grinned. I couldn't help it. This was Master Hobb—the man who'd complained about my work ethic daily for three years, who expressed affection through insult and loyalty through logistics—stepping into a role he'd been built for and had spent two decades pretending he didn't want.

"Forty-eight hours," I said. "What do you need from us?"

"Stay invisible. Keep the Fault-Sight boy—" he pointed at me "—away from anything that generates System alerts. And give me twenty copies of the Quiet Audit evidence in formats that don't require a scholar to read."

Ilya nodded. "I'll prepare simplified versions. Key names, dates, specific erasures. Things people can verify against their own experience."

"Good. When a baker reads that his neighbor was erased from the registry and realizes it matches the day the neighbor's shop was seized—that's not politics. That's personal. Personal moves faster than ideology."

---

Hobb left before midnight, wearing the coat of a man going to check on his shop after a long trip and carrying nothing that would interest a patrol. No weapons. No evidence. No exploits. Just a middle-aged provisioner with a story about supply chain issues that would bore any guard into letting him pass.

It was, I realized, the most dangerous thing any of us could do. Not because of the physical risk—though that was real—but because Hobb was building something that didn't require a Nullwright, didn't require Thread or exploits or ancient intelligences. He was building trust. Person to person. Shop to shop. The oldest network technology in existence.

And it would be invisible to every surveillance system the Concordance had, because it ran on a protocol they'd never bothered to monitor: conversation between people they'd already dismissed.

The rest of us split to pre-arranged positions. Nia disappeared into the courier shadow routes she still remembered, checking which paths were clear and which had been compromised. Sable went to contact his information networks—signal brokers and rumor traders who operated in every district, selling whispers to anyone with tokens.

Ilya and I found shelter in a disused attic above a chandler's shop two blocks from Hobb's grocer. The chandler, apparently, was one of Hobb's people from before—a woman named Drassa who'd let us in without a word, pointed at the ceiling hatch, and gone back to dipping candles with the unshakeable calm of someone who'd been expecting this for months.

"She didn't even ask who we were," I said, settling into the dusty attic space.

"She didn't need to. Hobb told her someone might come. She trusts Hobb."

"Everyone trusts Hobb."

"Not everyone. But the ones who do would walk through fire for him, and that's enough."

I sat by the attic window, watching the city through a gap in the shutters. Veyrun at night was a different animal than the daytime panic machine I'd fled months ago. Quieter. Ward lights hummed at intersections, casting blue-white pools that made shadows sharper. Patrol boots echoed in patterns I was already memorizing—every six minutes on the main thoroughfare, every fifteen on the cross-streets.

Through Fault-Sight, the city's System architecture was dense—layers of permission, surveillance, and control woven so tightly that the air itself felt regulated. Compared to the Freeholds' loose, gap-riddled infrastructure, Veyrun was a locked room.

But locked rooms had keys. And keys had tolerances. And tolerances had faults.

I could see them. Tiny imperfections in the surveillance mesh where overlapping jurisdictions created micro-gaps. Maintenance cycles that left brief windows of reduced monitoring. Ward boundaries that assumed building layouts which had changed since their last calibration.

The city was controlled. But it was controlled by a system designed for a city that no longer exactly matched its assumptions.

The Concordance was optimized against threats it understood: smugglers, rogue classes, organized crime, external invasion. It was not optimized against a Nullwright with a diagnostic lens and a grocer with a grudge.

That thought made me almost hopeful, which was a feeling I treated with suspicion on principle.

---

Two hours before dawn, Hobb came back.

He smelled like flour, coal, and the specific brand of cheap tea that Veyrun shopkeepers drank when they were staying up late to discuss things that mattered. His coat had a new dusting of baking powder on the left shoulder, suggesting a bakery. The right pocket bulged with what turned out to be a wax-sealed list of names in a hand that wasn't his.

"Fourteen," he said.

"Fourteen what?"

"Fourteen shopkeepers willing to serve as distribution points. Six more considering. Three said no but won't inform." He set the list on the floor. "Plus two canal maintenance supervisors who control access to sub-level tunnels, one laundry operator whose facility backs onto the Ledger Guard barracks and who has been wanting to cause problems for them since they raised her water tariff, and a retired printer who still has a working press in his basement."

"You did this in six hours."

"I did this in three. The other three were spent drinking tea and listening to people tell me how angry they are. Turns out when you erase four thousand names from a registry, some of those names have families. And families talk to their baker."

He sat heavily, the energy of purpose fading into the exhaustion underneath it. Hobb was forty-eight years old and had spent the night walking a locked-down city on a mission that could get him executed.

I handed him the flask from our supplies. He drank without asking what was in it, which told me more about his state than any words would.

"The evidence works," he said. "Ilya's simplified versions. Tallen—the baker—read his copy and went white. His brother-in-law was on the list. Erased three years ago. Tallen was told the man relocated voluntarily." He paused. "He didn't relocate."

"No."

"Tallen has a copy for every regular customer. He'll distribute through bread orders. Brown paper wrapping, evidence inside, delivered with the morning loaves." Hobb almost smiled. "The Concordance can surveil crystals and kiosks. Can they surveil bread?"

"Not without alienating every citizen who eats."

"Which is everyone."

I looked at the list. Fourteen names. Real people. Bakers, hardware sellers, chandlers, launderers, printers. The invisible infrastructure of a city that had been organized against them without their consent.

And now, organizing back.

A notification appeared in my status pane. Not the Custodian—a standard System alert, the kind that tracked environmental conditions.

**DISTRICT 9: Civil stability index shift detected**
**Source: Information distribution pattern (non-digital)**
**Classification: Anomalous but below threshold**
**Action: Logged. No enforcement response triggered.**

Below threshold. The System had noticed, at some level, that something was moving through the district's social fabric. But it didn't know what. The distribution method—word of mouth, paper in bread, conversations in shops—existed beneath the monitoring layer's resolution.

We were too small to see. For now.

"Forty-eight hours," I said. "You asked for forty-eight. You did it in six."

"I asked for forty-eight because I'm old and wanted sleep time built in." He drained the flask. "The network will grow on its own now. I planted seeds. The soil was already ready."

"Because people were already angry."

"Because people were always angry. They just didn't have permission to do anything about it." He set the flask down. "The Quiet Audit evidence isn't a weapon, kid. It's permission. It tells people: you weren't crazy. The thing you suspected was real. And here's proof."

He hauled himself up, every joint protesting, and headed for the attic's makeshift bedroll. "Wake me when something explodes. With you involved, I'm estimating four hours."

"Your faith in me is touching."

"My faith in chaos is what's touching. You're just the delivery mechanism."

He was asleep in under a minute. Hobb's ability to sleep in hostile environments was either a skill he'd developed through years of practice or a fundamental disregard for danger. Probably both.

I stayed at the window, watching the city breathe. Patrol lights swept. Ward hums cycled. Somewhere, a baker was wrapping evidence in bread paper.

The Custodian was quiet. Maybe it couldn't reach me here, inside Veyrun's dense authority layer. Maybe it was waiting. Maybe it understood that some revolutions started in places older than code—in kitchens and shops and the anger of people who'd been told their neighbors had simply gone away.

I pressed my forehead against the cold shutter and let Fault-Sight paint the city's architecture across my closed eyelids. All those layers of control. All those careful rules. All those assumptions about where threats came from and what they looked like.

None of them looked like bread.

**STATUS UPDATE:**
**Location: Veyrun, District 9 (covert re-entry)**
**Cover: Intact (sealed channel entry undetected)**
**Street network: 14 active nodes, expanding**
**Distribution method: Analog (below System monitoring threshold)**
**Evidence status: Circulating via civilian logistics**
**Concordance awareness: Low (anomaly logged, no enforcement)**
**Thread: 15**
**Attention: 15 Concordance watchers (not updated — re-entry undetected)**
**Personal note: Hobb is the most dangerous person on this team. He's not the strongest or the fastest or the most magical. He just knows everyone's name.**
**And names, it turns out, are harder to erase than the Concordance thought.**
