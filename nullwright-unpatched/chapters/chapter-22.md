# Chapter 22 — Patch Storm

I forgot Nia's name for six seconds.

Not in the way you forget a word and it comes back—like sneezing in reverse. This was different. I was mid-sentence, looking directly at her, and the space where her name lived in my head was just… smooth. Blank wall where a door should be. She was the woman with knives and silver-tipped braid who I trusted with my life, and for six seconds she was a stranger standing in a basement who I trusted with my life.

Then it came back. Nia. *Nia.* Like finding a coin in a pocket you'd already checked.

She saw it happen. I know because she stopped talking and her hand moved to my shoulder—not the knife hand, the other one, the one she used for real things—and she said my name twice.

"I'm fine," I said.

"You went away."

"Just thinking."

"You stopped blinking for six seconds, Kael. That's not thinking. That's a system error wearing a face."

Fair.

---

The patch storm hit District Nine at dawn like weather made of bureaucracy.

I'd felt normal patches before—the quiet ones Concordance pushed to harden exploited fault lines, close loopholes, tighten the world's stitching. Those were surgical. Precise. Like someone sewing a button back on.

This was a hailstorm of buttons.

Through Fault-Sight, the air itself was rewriting. Probability values I'd learned to read—friction coefficients at tunnel junctions, timing tolerances on relay valves, the little wobbles in authorization checks that gave me room to breathe—all of them were shifting. Not once. Continuously. Every few minutes, the local rules changed again, overwriting the overwrite, a cascade of corrections that turned stable ground into something like standing on a deck of cards being shuffled by a very angry dealer.

**SYSTEM NOTICE:**
**Regional Stability Protocol: Adaptive Rewrite (Active)**
**Affected Zone: Districts 7-11**
**Duration: Indefinite**
**Compliance required. Variance will be corrected.**

"They're not patching what I did," I said, staring at the shifting seams in the safehouse walls. "They're patching what I *might* do."

Ilya was already at the table, papers spread, her face wearing the expression she reserved for things that were theoretically fascinating and practically catastrophic. "Preemptive adaptive correction. They've modeled your exploit patterns and they're randomizing the conditions you rely on. Every fault line you've learned to read—"

"Moves before I can use it."

"Worse. Moves while you're using it."

I closed my eyes. Opened Fault-Sight. The familiar lattice of red stress lines was there, but they were… writhing. Shifting like snakes in a bag. Every seam I recognized twisted into something new before I could lock onto it. The signatures I'd spent weeks memorizing—valve timings, authorization gaps, the sweet spots where reality was just loose enough to nudge—all of it was being scrambled in real time.

It was like trying to read a book someone was rewriting as your eyes moved across the page.

"Okay," I said. "I can work with this."

I couldn't work with this.

---

The first supply run proved it.

Hobb's network needed three corridors open to move rations from the canal warehouses to the residential blocks. I'd been handling the exploitation layer—nudging locks, timing guard rotations through environmental desync, keeping the little mechanical cheats running that turned twenty-minute windows into thirty-minute ones.

Today the windows were shrinking.

I crouched at Junction 7-East, hands on a relay panel I'd opened a dozen times before. The fault line I needed was there—I could see it flickering red behind the conduit housing—but every time I reached for it with Thread, it slithered sideways. New values. New timing. The exploit that should have worked three seconds ago was already obsolete.

So I improvised.

Thread: 12. I could feel the number like a water level in my chest—lower than it should be, lower than it had been since the marsh. Every improvised exploit without the Null Anchor was like lifting weight without a spotter. No fallback. No safety reference point. Just me and raw Thread and the screaming hope that I'd calculated right.

I found a different fault. Newer, wobblier, created by the patch storm's own rewriting. The adaptive corrections were generating their own instabilities—tiny gaps between one version of reality and the next, like the space between shuffled cards.

I grabbed one.

The relay panel popped. The corridor opened. Thirty seconds of window instead of thirty minutes.

"Go," I said into the signal line.

Runners moved. Rations flowed. The window closed behind them like a mouth.

I slumped against the wall, trembling. Something warm trickled from my left nostril.

**BACKLASH: Cognitive Strain (Moderate)**
**Thread expenditure: 1.3 (Inefficient — no Anchor stabilization)**
**Current Thread: 10.7**
**Advisory: Extended improvisation without reference anchor increases neural drift risk.**

Neural drift.

Is that what we were calling it.

---

By noon I'd opened five corridors and lost two memories.

The first was small—I couldn't remember where I'd put my jacket that morning. Trivial. The kind of thing anyone forgets. Except I hadn't forgotten *where*. I'd forgotten that I *owned* a jacket. Nia handed it to me and I looked at it like an artifact from someone else's life until context rebuilt itself from surrounding facts: cold morning, this fabric, my arms, jacket.

The second was worse.

I was descending a maintenance shaft with Sable when he referenced the Collegium archive heist. "Like when we pulled the records from the ghost archive," he said, grinning his grin, the one that meant he was either about to help or sell you out and was enjoying not knowing which.

I nodded.

He looked at me.

"You don't remember the archive," he said. Not a question.

"I remember the archive."

"What did the entrance look like?"

I opened my mouth. Closed it. The memory was there—I could feel its shape, its weight, the fact of it—but the content was gone. Like a file folder with a label but no papers inside.

"Round door," I guessed. "Stone surround."

"Square. Metal. With a mural of a burning eye."

"Right. Yeah. The eye."

He didn't believe me. I didn't believe me.

"How bad is it?" he asked, and for once the performance dropped from his voice.

"Manageable."

"That's not an answer."

"It's the one I've got."

---

The afternoon meeting was Nia's idea, which meant it was an intervention dressed as strategy.

She'd gathered them in the laundry basement—Nia, Ilya, Hobb, Sable. The core. My people. The ones who'd built this thing with me and were now watching me crack at the seams like one of my own fault lines.

I sat on a crate. They stood. That geometry alone told me everything.

Ilya went first because Ilya always went first when things needed clinical precision. "The patch storm is specifically designed to force you into high-cost improvisation. Every standard exploit path you've established is being scrambled. Your only option is novel solutions, which require disproportionate Thread expenditure, which—without the Null Anchor—produces cumulative cognitive backlash."

"I know what's happening to me, Ilya."

"Then you know it's accelerating. You've lost Thread at three times the recovery rate. At this pace, you'll be below functional threshold within forty-eight hours."

Silence. The laundry machines hummed somewhere above us, the rhythm of a normal world still doing normal things.

Hobb spoke without looking at me. He was examining a crack in the wall like it owed him money. "How many corridors did you open today?"

"Five."

"How many can you open tomorrow?"

I thought about it honestly. The Thread cost of each improvised exploit was climbing as the patch storm adapted to my adaptations. A spiral. An arms race played on my nervous system.

"Two. Maybe three."

"We need six to maintain supply flow."

"I know."

He finally looked at me. Hobb's face was built for disapproval—craggy, weathered, default expression suggesting that you'd personally caused the rain. But underneath the disapproval was something I'd only seen twice: once when he talked about his dead wife, and once when he found me after the marsh crossing with blood running from my ears.

Fear. Hobb was afraid for me.

"Then we need a plan for when you can't open any," he said.

"I can still—"

"No." Nia's voice. Sharp. Final. "We need a plan for when you *can't*, Kael. Not because you're weak. Because they've built a weapon that specifically targets what you do, and it's working, and pretending otherwise is going to get you killed or—" She stopped.

"Or?"

"Or worse than killed."

She meant cognitive collapse. Identity erosion. The thing Ilya had warned about months ago—that if a Nullwright burned Thread past critical threshold without an anchor, the System wouldn't need to erase them. They'd erase themselves. Memory by memory. Skill by skill. Until what was left was a body that breathed and blinked and didn't remember why.

The room was quiet enough to hear the water pipes.

"So what's the plan?" I asked.

They looked at each other. They'd already discussed this. Before I arrived. Without me.

That stung more than the nosebleeds.

Nia pulled out a folded paper. "If you're incapacitated—temporarily or otherwise—the network continues. Hobb handles logistics. Sable handles intelligence. Ilya handles technical countermeasures. I handle operations."

"You divided up my job."

"We divided up the parts of the job that don't require being a Nullwright. The parts that are people, not powers." She held my gaze. "You built something bigger than your abilities, Kael. That's the point. If it falls apart without you, it was never real."

"Inspiring. You should do broadsheets."

"I'm serious."

"I know you're serious. That's why I'm deflecting with humor. It's my *thing*, Nia. Let me have my thing."

Sable leaned against the wall, arms crossed. "There's also the question of what happens if you go non-responsive during an operation. If you blank out in the field—"

"I won't—"

"Six seconds this morning. That's what Nia reported. Six seconds of nobody home. What if it's sixty? What if it's six minutes and you're standing in a corridor with Ledger Guard on both ends?"

I didn't answer because he was right and I hated it.

Ilya placed something on the crate beside me. A small brass disc etched with concentric circles. "Sable acquired this from a Patchless contact. It's a crude cognitive anchor—nowhere near the functionality of what you lost, but it can store a basic identity reference. Your name, your location, your last hour. If you drift, pressing this against your palm should pull you back to baseline."

I picked it up. It was warm. Cheap. The kind of thing a street vendor might sell as a good luck charm.

"How reliable is it?"

"Sixty percent. Maybe."

"Sixty percent."

"It's what we have."

I closed my fingers around it. Sixty percent chance of remembering my own name. This was my life now.

**STATUS UPDATE:**
**Patch Storm: Active (Day 1)**
**Corridors opened: 5/6 required (supply flow at 83%)**
**Thread: 10.7 (critical decline rate)**
**Memory events: 2 confirmed gaps (minor, moderate)**
**Cognitive anchor (improvised): Acquired**
**Null Anchor: LOST (Ch. 19 — unrecovered)**
**Incapacitation protocol: Drafted by allies. Command distribution: Hobb/Nia/Sable/Ilya.**

I couldn't sleep that night.

Not insomnia. Something weirder. Every time I started to drift off, my brain would *check*—like a reflex, like touching a wall to make sure it was solid. Am I still me? Is this still now? The brass disc was pressed against my chest and I held it like a child holds a toy in the dark, which is exactly what it was, and I knew it, and I held it anyway.

The Custodian spoke at 3 AM.

Not a prompt—a single line of clean blue text appearing on the inside of my eyelids like a whisper printed in light:

**You are being optimized against. Stop optimizing.**

I opened my eyes. The text faded.

"Easy for you to say," I whispered to the dark. "You're distributed across a root network. I'm distributed across one increasingly unreliable skull."

No response.

I lay there and tried to remember my mother's face. Got it—barely. The shape of her jaw. The way she hummed while cooking. Then I tried to remember the sound of the humming and it was gone. Not patch-storm gone. Just regular gone. The kind of forgetting that happens to everyone, the slow erosion that time does for free.

The difference was I couldn't tell anymore which memories I'd lost to time and which ones the storm had eaten.

That distinction mattered. I needed it to matter.

I pressed the disc harder against my ribs and breathed.

---

Day two.

I opened two corridors. The third attempt put me on the floor.

Not dramatic—not the cinematic collapse with outstretched hand and whispered last words. Just… the floor. One moment I was reaching for a fault line that was already somewhere else, and the next I was sitting on metal grating with Nia's hand on the back of my neck and Sable standing over me with an expression I'd never seen on his face before.

Concern. Genuine, uncomposed concern. On Sable. It looked wrong, like finding a cat wearing a suit.

"I'm okay," I said.

"You were speaking Old Lattice notation," Ilya said from behind them. She was pale. "For forty seconds. Your eyes were open and you were reciting maintenance codes from a layer you've never accessed."

"So… not okay."

"Not okay."

I checked my status.

**Thread: 8.4**
**Cognitive integrity: DECLINING**
**System advisory: Nullwright function approaching minimum viability. Recommend cessation of exploit activity.**

Eight-point-four. I'd started this war at sixteen. Lost four to the Halden fight and the anchor sacrifice. Burned another four in two days of patch-storm improvisation. At this rate, by tomorrow—

"Don't," Nia said.

"Don't what?"

"Don't do the math. I can see you doing the math. The math is not your friend right now."

"The math is never my friend. The math and I have a complicated relationship based on mutual hostility."

She almost smiled. Almost.

Hobb appeared in the corridor entrance carrying a canvas sack. He took one look at me on the floor, set the sack down, and said, "Supply flow dropped to sixty percent. Two corridors isn't enough."

"I know."

"So we find another way."

"What other way?"

He opened the sack. Maps. Old ones—hand-drawn, pre-Concordance, showing tunnel networks that predated the current maintenance layer. "These are from a contact in the Patchless. Routes that don't use exploited fault lines because they don't use fault lines at all. Physical paths. Hidden doors. Gaps in the architecture, not the code."

"Old-fashioned smuggling," Sable said, and for the first time today he sounded like himself.

"Old-fashioned survival," Hobb corrected. "We ran routes like this before there was a Nullwright. We'll run them again if we have to." He looked at me. "Rest. Actual rest. Twelve hours minimum. If I hear you've touched a fault line before tomorrow noon, I'll lock you in the pantry."

"You can't—"

"Try me."

---

I rested.

Not because I agreed, but because my body voted against me. I lay on a cot in the back of the laundry basement and my muscles simply refused further participation. Every joint ached with the specific deep-bone exhaustion that comes from burning Thread without a safety net—like I'd been carrying something too heavy for too long and my arms had finally gone on strike.

The brass disc sat on my chest. I pressed it every twenty minutes like a reflex.

*Kael Voss. Laundry basement. District Nine. Tuesday. Nia has silver in her braid. Hobb counts things when he's scared. Ilya speaks carefully when she's terrified. Sable is performing even when he's honest, and honest even when he's performing.*

These were my people.

I held them in my head like stones in my pocket—smooth, heavy, real.

Somewhere above me, the patch storm continued its work, rewriting the rules of the world faster than anyone could learn them. Somewhere in the System's architecture, an algorithm was studying everything I'd ever done and building a cage of constantly shifting bars.

And somewhere deeper—below the patches, below the lattice, in the root seams where clean blue text lived—the Custodian waited with the patience of something that had been waiting since before patience had a name.

**You are being optimized against. Stop optimizing.**

I didn't know what that meant yet.

But I was going to find out.

If I could remember to.

**STATUS UPDATE:**
**Location: Veyrun, District 9 (laundry basement)**
**Patch Storm: Active (Day 2)**
**Corridors opened: 2/6 (supply flow 60%)**
**Alternative routes: Under development (Hobb/Patchless maps)**
**Level: 15**
**Thread: 8.4 (critical)**
**Attention: 31 watchers**
**Memory: 3 confirmed gaps. Cognitive anchor operational (untested under stress).**
**Incapacitation protocol: Active. Allies briefed. Command distributed.**
**Personal note: They planned for me breaking. That should feel like betrayal. Instead it feels like the first genuinely smart thing we've done. Love is not the same as dependence, and a movement that needs one person to function is just a cult with better marketing.**
**I'm scared. Writing that down because if I forget it later, I want future-me to know that present-me was honest about it.**
**The disc is warm against my chest.**
**Hold on to things.**

*End of Chapter 22*
