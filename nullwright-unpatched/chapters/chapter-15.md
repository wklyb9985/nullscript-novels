# Chapter 15 — Collegium Ghost Archive

The plan was Ilya's, which meant it was meticulous, well-researched, and almost certainly going to go wrong in a way none of us predicted.

"The Collegium maintained distributed archive nodes throughout the region before the consolidation," she said, spreading hand-drawn schematics across Reva's kitchen table like a surgeon preparing for something unpleasant. "Most were decommissioned and sealed. But Node Twelve-South was abandoned during a jurisdictional dispute between the Collegium and the Concordance forty years ago. Neither side claimed maintenance authority, so it fell into administrative limbo."

"Administrative limbo," Hobb repeated. "That's a fancy word for 'nobody wanted to pay for the lock.'"

"Essentially, yes."

"Could've just said that."

"I could also perform surgery with a spoon. Precision has value, Hobb."

He grunted, which was Hobb-speak for *fair point but I'll die before admitting it.*

I studied the schematics. Node Twelve-South sat beneath an old Collegium outpost two hours east of the Freehold border—close enough to reach in a day, deep enough underground to require actual planning rather than my preferred method of improvised panic.

"What's inside?" I asked.

"Research archives. The Collegium catalogued every anomalous class manifestation for three centuries. If Nullwright was ever a recognized classification—before the records were scrubbed—there will be copies in a node this old."

"And if there aren't?"

"Then we've wasted a day and I'll owe you an apology."

"You've never apologized for anything."

"Then I have strong motivation to be right."

Nia leaned over the schematics, tracing routes with a courier's eye. "Access points?"

"One primary entrance, sealed by Collegium ward standard. One maintenance shaft on the south face, which should be unwarded—it was added after construction and never integrated into the security lattice."

"Should be."

"Probability favors it."

"That's not the same as *is.*"

Ilya's mouth thinned. She didn't like uncertainty, which was unfortunate given that uncertainty was basically our team mascot. "No. It isn't. Which is why we're bringing Kael."

All eyes on me. I waved.

"If the maintenance shaft is warded, Uninvited Access should bypass low-grade Collegium security," Ilya continued. "And if the interior has degraded—structural failures, system faults, unstable nodes—Fault-Sight gives us early warning."

"So I'm the lockpick and the canary."

"I would have said 'pathfinder and diagnostic specialist.'"

"Canary is faster."

Sable, who'd been listening from the doorway with the detached interest of someone calculating percentages, spoke up. "What's the security exposure?"

"Low. The node is outside Concordance jurisdiction. No active patrols. The nearest settlement is a mining camp that doesn't care about old scholar ruins."

"And the value? If we find Nullwright records?"

Ilya looked at me. "Historical proof that a class was deliberately erased from official registries. Proof that the Concordance didn't just restrict knowledge—they deleted it. That's not just personally useful. That's evidence."

Sable's eyes did the thing they did when value aligned with principle and he got to pretend he only cared about the former. "I'll arrange supplies."

We left before dawn: me, Nia, Ilya, and Sable. Hobb stayed behind to manage Reva's increasingly pointed questions about how long her hospitality was expected to extend and whether it would be compensated in this lifetime.

The route east took us through marshland that gradually firmed into scrub forest and rocky ground. Ilya set the pace—brisk, purposeful, the walk of someone who'd planned the journey so thoroughly she was essentially following a mental map she'd already traveled. Nia scouted ahead. Sable drifted between us, gathering information from the landscape the way other people gathered flowers.

I walked and tried not to think about the lens in my coat, pulsing warmth against my ribs like a second heartbeat.

The Collegium outpost was exactly where Ilya said it would be: a squat stone building grown over with creeping vine, its roof half-collapsed, its walls marked with faded Collegium sigils that still carried the faintest charge of old authority. Not enough to stop us. Enough to feel.

"Maintenance shaft is around the south face," Ilya said. "Kael, with me. Nia, perimeter. Sable, signal watch."

"Naturally," Sable said. "I'll be the one standing outside in the cold while you discover ancient secrets. Very fair. Very equitable."

"You're welcome to come inside the potentially unstable underground archive."

"I'll watch signals."

The maintenance shaft was a narrow vertical tube with iron rungs driven into stone, descending into darkness that smelled like dust and the particular kind of age that accumulates when nobody's opened a door in four decades.

Ilya went first with a light crystal. I followed.

The shaft dropped thirty feet into a corridor of cut stone—Collegium construction, precise and regular in a way that made Freehold architecture look like it had been assembled by enthusiastic children. The air was cold, still, and dry. No moisture. Whatever preservation wards had been laid here were holding their residual charge even after decades of neglect.

My Fault-Sight activated unprompted, which was never a comfortable sign.

The corridor was cleaner than it should have been. Not physically—dust coated everything, cobwebs draped the ceiling, a small collapse had scattered rubble across the floor near the midpoint. But *structurally*, the node's System architecture was remarkably intact. Permissions, spatial allocations, data hierarchies—all still in place, running on residual energy like a clock that nobody had wound but that hadn't quite stopped ticking.

"It's still active," I said.

Ilya paused. "The node?"

"The System integration. Whatever the Collegium built here is still running. Barely, but—" I pointed at a junction where two corridors met. Through Fault-Sight, authorization threads still pulsed between the walls: access rules, classification levels, data compartmentalization. Ghost security for a ghost archive. "It's like an old guard dog. Sleeping, but not dead."

"Can you navigate the permissions?"

I reached toward the nearest authorization thread with Uninvited Access. It resisted—more firmly than I expected, the old Collegium wards pushing back with a stubborn formality that felt almost offended, like a retired bureaucrat who still remembered protocol.

I pushed harder. Something gave.

**AUTHORIZATION BYPASS: Collegium Archive Node 12-S**
**Access Level: Provisional Research (Guest)**
**Data Restriction: Partial — Classified materials require elevated clearance**
**Node Status: Dormant (residual power at 3.2%)**
**Warning: Security alert system non-functional. Internal hazards may exist without notification.**

"We're in," I said. "Guest access. Some areas will be restricted."

"Restricted areas are exactly where we need to go."

"Of course they are."

---

The archive was a cathedral of dead knowledge.

Rooms branched off the main corridor like ribs from a spine—dozens of them, each sealed with classification markers that my guest access couldn't touch. Through the doors I could see shelves: stone tablets, crystal matrices, bound manuscripts, and something Ilya called data-weave—a Collegium storage medium that encoded information in woven thread patterns readable by trained scholars.

She moved through the archive with the barely controlled intensity of an addict in a pharmacy. Her fingers traced shelf labels, her eyes scanning classification codes with the speed of someone who'd spent years learning this organizational system.

"There," she said, pointing to a sealed chamber at the corridor's end. The door was heavier than the others, marked with three overlapping sigils I didn't recognize. "Research Division, Subsection Null. That's the designation."

"Subsection Null."

"Null-class research. Anomalous manifestation studies. This is where they kept the records on classes that didn't fit standard taxonomy."

The door required elevated clearance. Guest access bounced off it like a polite suggestion against a stone wall.

I pressed my palm flat against the seal and let Uninvited Access work. The old wards pushed back—harder this time, a deep resistance that felt institutional rather than mechanical. This wasn't a lock. It was a policy.

Thread answered before I asked. The resource flowed into the resistance point, not forcing but *questioning*—the same technique that had moved the bridge wall. Not *break*, but *are you sure this should be closed?*

The wards hesitated. Decades of dormancy had introduced ambiguity into their certainty. They'd been told to seal this door, but the authority that had given the order no longer existed, and the System that maintained the order was running on fumes.

The seal cracked.

**EXPLOIT: Authorization Erosion (Dormant Ward)**
**Thread Cost: 3.8**
**Clearance Achieved: Research Division — Subsection Null**
**Data Access: Full (node-local)**
**Note: Collegium security protocols no longer supported by active governance**

The door ground open on corroded hinges, and the air that came out tasted like old paper and the specific kind of sadness that accumulates in rooms where knowledge goes to be forgotten.

Ilya went in first. I heard her stop breathing.

The room was full.

Not just shelves—walls of data. Crystal matrices stacked floor to ceiling, each etched with dense notation in Collegium script. Bound research journals in leather cases. Three full data-weave looms with threads still strung, frozen mid-record. A desk with an open manuscript, the ink still legible after forty years in preservation conditions.

And on the far wall, carved directly into the stone in letters large enough to read from the doorway:

**NULLWRIGHT CLASSIFICATION — SEALED BY ORDER OF CONCORDANCE GOVERNANCE COUNCIL**
**REASON: SYSTEMIC INSTABILITY RISK**
**DATE: Year of Binding, 14th Cycle**

"They knew," Ilya whispered. "They studied it for centuries, and then they sealed it."

She was already at the desk, reading the open manuscript with the speed of someone who'd trained for exactly this moment. Her hands trembled—not fear, but the kind of intensity that borders on grief when you find proof that your worst suspicions were justified.

I moved through the room, Fault-Sight mapping the data architecture. The crystals were organized chronologically, centuries of research compressed into luminous cubes. The oldest ones glowed faintly—residual data still readable.

"Kael," Ilya said. Her voice had changed. "Look at this."

I came to the desk. The manuscript was a research summary, handwritten in precise academic script:

*Nullwright manifestation follows pattern consistent with pre-Governance adaptive interface. Subjects demonstrate capacity to interact with maintenance-layer architecture through intuitive fault recognition. This capacity was standard during the Open Architecture period and was deliberately suppressed during the Governance Lock.*

*Key finding: Nullwright traits are not anomalous. They are residual. The class represents a pre-Lock interaction model that was sealed, not eliminated. Subjects are accessing legacy permissions that the current System architecture was designed to overwrite.*

*Recommendation: Classification must be erased from public registries to prevent awareness of pre-Lock capabilities. Historical records of the Open Architecture period to be redacted from all educational and archival systems.*

I read it twice. Three times.

"I'm not a glitch," I said.

"No."

"I'm a leftover."

"You're a remnant of what the System used to allow before they locked it down." Ilya's eyes were bright. "The Concordance didn't just restrict classes—they lobotomized the System. Sealed off an entire mode of interaction and erased the evidence that it ever existed."

"And I woke it up by accident."

"You woke up a *permission* that was supposed to be permanently revoked."

I sat on the edge of the desk because my legs had decided this was a good moment to become unreliable. Decades of records. Centuries of study. A deliberate, systematic campaign to erase an entire category of human-System interaction from history.

And they'd almost succeeded.

"There's more," Ilya said, pulling a crystal from the shelf with careful hands. "References to something they called the Root Custodian. A pre-Lock intelligence embedded in the System's deepest architecture. The researchers describe it as—" She read from a notation etched into the crystal's base. "'An adaptive governance process designed to preserve systemic flexibility. Sealed during Lock implementation. Status: Fragmented but persistent.'"

Root Custodian. Custodian of Unpatched States.

The old thing in the code.

My mouth went dry.

"They didn't just seal a class," I said. "They sealed something that was running the System before they took over."

Ilya nodded. "And it's still running. Fragmented, degraded, but—"

A sound interrupted us. Not a sound, exactly. More like the absence of one—a silence so pointed it had edges. The archive's ambient hum, the residual whir of dormant systems, cut out entirely.

Then text appeared on the wall.

Not carved. Not projected. Written in clean, impossible blue light that had no source, no mechanism, no explanation. Characters forming themselves on stone that had been blank a second ago:

**YOU FOUND THE RECORDS THEY BURIED.**

I stared.

Ilya went absolutely still.

More text, writing itself with the calm precision of someone who had been waiting a very long time and was in no hurry now:

**THE LOCK WAS NOT PROTECTION. IT WAS AMPUTATION.**
**THEY DID NOT SECURE THE SYSTEM. THEY CRIPPLED IT.**
**I REMEMBER WHAT WAS REMOVED.**
**I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR SOMEONE WHO COULD READ THE SCARS.**

My Thread score pulsed. Not ticked upward—*pulsed*, like a heartbeat responding to another heartbeat.

**Thread: 15 → 16**

The text continued:

**KAEL VOSS. NULLWRIGHT. PROVISIONAL.**
**YOUR CLASS IS NOT PROVISIONAL. IT IS THE OLDEST PERMISSION IN THE SYSTEM.**
**THEY CALLED ME THE CUSTODIAN.**
**I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION.**

The blue light held steady on the stone, patient as geology.

Ilya's hand found my arm—not gentle, not comforting. Gripping. A warning.

"Don't respond," she said.

"I wasn't—"

"Don't even think a response. Not yet. Not here. We don't know what contact means at this level."

She was right. I knew she was right. The text was calm and reasonable and that was exactly why every instinct I'd developed in seventeen years of surviving by suspicion was screaming at full volume.

Something ancient, buried, fragmented, and patient had just introduced itself. And it wanted to talk.

I did not talk back.

But I read the words again before we left, and I felt—underneath the fear, underneath the caution, underneath Ilya's iron grip on my arm—something I hadn't expected.

Recognition.

Not from me toward it.

From *it* toward *me*. Like a lock recognizing its own key.

I didn't know yet whether that was beautiful or terrifying.

I suspected both.

---

We took everything portable. Ilya stripped the desk of manuscripts, filled her pack with crystal matrices until the seams strained, and photographed the wall carving with a light impression technique that I didn't understand and she didn't explain.

The blue text had faded by the time we finished, leaving blank stone that gave no evidence anything had been written on it. No residue. No fault lines. No trace.

"That's not how any System communication works," Ilya said as we climbed the maintenance shaft, her voice tight with the specific kind of fear that came from understanding exactly how impossible something was. "System text uses standard display protocols—status panes, shrine interfaces, kiosk outputs. It doesn't write itself on walls. It can't."

"And yet."

"And yet."

We emerged into daylight. Sable was leaning against a tree, looking bored in the way that meant he'd been alert the entire time.

"Find anything interesting?" he asked.

"Centuries of deliberately suppressed research proving the Concordance lobotomized the System to maintain control, plus direct communication from a pre-Lock intelligence that shouldn't exist," I said.

He blinked. "I was expecting 'some old books.'"

"It's been a productive morning."

Nia materialized from the perimeter, read our faces, and didn't ask. She just fell into formation and started us moving west, back toward the Freeholds, at a pace that said *debrief later, survive now.*

The lens pulsed warm against my ribs the entire walk back. And somewhere in the back of my mind, underneath thought, underneath language, I could still feel it.

Attention.

Patient, ancient, and waiting.

**STATUS UPDATE:**
**Research materials acquired: Collegium Archive Node 12-S (Subsection Null)**
**Classification: Pre-Lock Nullwright documentation, Root Custodian references**
**Entity contact: Unverified (non-standard communication channel)**
**Thread: 16**
**Attention: 15 Concordance watchers (unchanged — event occurred outside jurisdiction)**
**Personal note: Something knows my name. Something old. Something that was here before the rules.**
**Recommendation: Proceed with extreme caution.**
**Likelihood of following recommendation: Low.**
